            <p>Philo's opening remarks suggest that deep attachments are incompatible
with self-love, since they demand humble &quot;devotion&quot;: whereas Antony's
focus has previously been on maintaining his position as the &quot;triple
pillar of the world,&quot; he is now &quot;a strumpet's fool&quot; (1.1.1-15). The
erotic hierarchy which the play outlines is designed to expose this
incompatibility. Of the four main characters of the play, Enobarbus is
ultimately humbled by his devotion; Cleopatra and Caesar reap the
rewards and endure the consequences of being almost purely
self-regarding; while Antony occupies an uneasy middle ground. The terms
self-regard and self-love are used interchangeably in this essay to
refer to the natural demands of the ego, including what Shakespeare
would call pride or ambition, which is essentially a concern to
distinguish oneself in the eyes of others, and the instinct for
self-preservation. Both are contrasted to the paradoxical form of
self-interest which recognises that the desire to establish a perfectly
harmonious intimacy with a beloved may only be satisfied through
self-denying service.</p>
<h1>Enobarbus</h1>
<p>Enobarbus' attitude to Cleopatra is typically ambivalent: although he
comments sardonically on Antony's subjugation to the queen during his
initial appearance, his first act is to drink to her health (1.2.79,
1.2.12-13). When Antony informs him of his decision to return to Rome,
he declares that women should &quot;be esteem'd nothing&quot; compared to &quot;a great
cause,&quot; and implies that the queen is a temporary distraction
encountered in the course of his master's &quot;travel,&quot; while at the same
time warning him ironically that &quot;Cleopatra, catching but the least
noise of this, dies instantly,&quot; as she has done &quot;twenty times&quot; before
(1.2.137-55). Later in the play, however, Enobarbus gives a much more
passionate account of this &quot;wonderful piece of work,&quot; despite his clear
understanding that her first encounter with Antony was as carefully
planned as her multiple 'deaths' (1.2.153-55): her servants &quot;made their
bends adornings;&quot; her ship was &quot;burnish'd&quot; and &quot;perfum'd;&quot; while her own
beauty was artificially enhanced, like a painting in which &quot;the fancy
outwork[s] nature&quot; (2.2.191-218). Overall, despite his characteristic
sardonicism, which emerges again when he concludes that his master has
in fact been induced to &quot;pay his heart for what his eyes eat only&quot;
(2.2.225-26), Enobarbus clearly feels the full power of Cleopatra's
charm, which he declares &quot;age cannot wither...nor custom stale&quot;
(2.2.232-39). He is much more intensely erotic than his Roman
interlocutors, as is underlined by the contrast between his poetic
evocation of the queen's beauty and Agrippa's prosaically expressed
account, which concentrates entirely on her political influence: &quot;She
made great Caesar lay his sword to bed; he ploughed her, and she
cropp'd&quot; (2.2.297-98).</p>
<p>Just as Enobarbus gives a partial view of Cleopatra in his opening
conversation with Antony, he also controls his shock at Fulvia's death,
which is so intense that the news has to be repeated to him twice before
he can collect himself sufficiently to declare dismissively that &quot;the
tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow,&quot; since his
master's &quot;old smock brings forth a new petticoat&quot; (1.2.156-70). Taken
together, Enobarbus' layered reactions both to Cleopatra's attractions
and Fulvia's death suggest that he habitually detaches himself from his
own emotions, adopting a hard-bitten persona, but that he is in fact
much more passionate than he wishes to acknowledge. The jauntily cynical
tone of his advice to Antony disguises the seriousness of his attempt
both to arm him against Cleopatra's wiles, which he knows might
otherwise easily thwart his attempt to return to Rome, and to soothe any
sadness or guilt that he might feel over Fulvia's death.</p>
<p>The frankness with which Antony discusses his feelings about Cleopatra
with Enobarbus in their opening conversation shows the depth of the
intimacy between the two men (1.2.145-52). Cleopatra acknowledges this
when she twice assumes that Enobarbus can interpret her own lover's
behaviour better than she is able to (4.2.13, 4.2.23). This
long-standing friendship has been sustained not only by serious, or
semi-serious strategic discussions such as the one analysed above, and
no doubt by the two friends' reliance on each other's support during
numerous military campaigns, but partly by their shared taste for
revelry: on Pompey's galley a drunken Enobarbus enthusiastically invites
his &quot;brave emperor [to] dance now the Egyptian bacchanals and
celebrate our drink,&quot; as he has no doubt done countless times before
(2.7.103-05). This exuberant love of drinking, dining, singing and
dancing is indicative of the underlying warm-heartedness which has
enabled Antony and Enobarbus to form a truly passionate attachment
(1.2.12-13, 1.2.45-46, 2.2.177-83, 2.6.72-74, 2.6.132-36, 2.7.94-118).
Whereas Caesar refuses to humble himself, like &quot;strong Enobarb [who]
is weaker than the wine,&quot; because he does not value the spontaneous
rapport which wine can encourage, but sees the loosening of his
&quot;tongue,&quot; which &quot;spleets what it speaks,&quot; merely as a handicap,
Enobarbus' drunkenness is a sign that joyous camaraderie matters more to
him than his dignity (2.7.121-24).</p>
<p>Although Enobarbus broadly supports Antony's decision to leave
Cleopatra, as we have seen, not only is he much more deeply affected by
her charm than the unerotic Philo, but his attitude to his political
ambitions is much more ambivalent (1.1.1-15). He endeavours to hold
himself aloof from the political world as far as is possible, even
though he is often required to become involved as one of Antony's chief
commanders. His refusal to &quot;entreat&quot; Antony to moderate his language in
his meeting with Caesar not only shows his fierce loyalty, but implies
that he prioritises &quot;private stomaching&quot; and individual &quot;passion&quot; over
political ambitions: &quot;I shall entreat him to answer like himself&quot;
(2.2.1-13). Taken together, his undiplomatic insistence that Caesar and
Antony are merely &quot;borrow[ing] one another's love&quot; temporarily, in
order to see off the threat of Pompey, and his mockery of Lepidus'
professed affection for the other members of the triumvirate point to an
underlying frustration with the pervasive fickleness of political life,
and conversely, one might assume, to a nature which is itself
distinguished by its passionate constancy (2.2.103-06, 3.2.6-20).</p>
<p>Generally, however, Enobarbus is sardonically resigned, rather than
passionately opposed, to this fickleness: after learning that Lepidus
has been imprisoned by Caesar, he comments sardonically that the world
now has just &quot;a pair of chaps,&quot; who will &quot;grind th' one the other&quot;
(3.5.7-15). His exposure to the brutal logic of power politics, in which
Antony is seemingly as willing as Caesar to &quot;borrow...love&quot; temporarily
for reasons of expediency, and then to attempt to &quot;grind&quot; his rival to
pieces, seems to be gradually corroding Enobarbus' personal loyalty to
his commander even before the disastrous naval battle: shortly after
making this latter comment he is summoned to Antony's presence, but,
despite the fact that there will clearly be much to talk about, since
&quot;the poor third is up,&quot; and Pompey has just been murdered by one of his
master's own officers, he merely remarks dismissively, &quot;'Twill be
naught, but let it be. Bring me to Antony&quot; (3.5.12, 3.5.23-24).
Moreover, there is evidence that Enobarbus too has become habituated to
the pursuit of profit and prestige during a lengthy succession of
campaigns, even though his underlying motive may all along have been to
support Antony's cause: he tells Pompey, &quot;I have prais'd ye when you
have well deserv'd ten times as much as I said you did,&quot; and agrees with
Menas that they have both behaved like organised &quot;thieves&quot; (2.6.75-78,
2.6.88-96). The very fact that he admits to his vanity and injustice,
however, albeit in his characteristic tone of detached flippancy,
implies that his passionate heart has by no means been completely
desensitised.</p>
<p>Enobarbus has also been hardened by the intrinsic harshness of war, as
is shown by his criticism of Caesar for weeping when bidding farewell to
his sister. The comparison which he draws between the emperor's tears
and the dark markings on a horse's face, traditionally considered a sign
of unreliability, implicitly reflects his view--born out of course by
the events leading up to his master's downfall--that sympathetic concern
is incompatible with the ruthless determination of a true warrior, as
does his insistence that, by contrast with Octavius, Antony himself did
not weep either at the death of Brutus or Julius Caesar, but was merely
&quot;troubled with a rheum&quot; (3.2.50-59). Later, he makes this point more
clearly when he rebukes Antony for expressing his gratitude to his
followers in such a maudlin manner: &quot;they weep, and I, an ass, am
onion-eyed. For shame, transform us not to women&quot; (4.2.15-33,
4.2.34-36). Both men agree at this moment that the speech might have an
enervating effect on men who are preparing for a major battle on the
following day (4.2.37-45).</p>
<p>Enobarbus' intervention in this speech also illustrates the conflict
between his cynical self-regard and his fundamentally passionate nature
(3.13.199-200). Even taken purely at face value, his concern for the
army's morale implies that he is still attached to a cause which he has
in fact already decided to desert -similarly he fetched Antony to
witness Cleopatra's perfidious flirtation with Thidias even after
apparently determining to &quot;leave [him] to his sinking&quot; (3.13.55-85).
On a deeper level, what he presents as prudent military advice could be
seen simply as a desperate attempt to prevent Antony's sad speech from
further aggravating the grief and guilt that he is already feeling at
the prospect of leaving his master. Although, he tries to dismiss the
speech, rightly or wrongly (see below), as a self-indulgent effort on
Antony's part to relish his popularity by &quot;mak[ing] his followers
weep,&quot; he clearly cannot repress his own tears entirely, even though he
brands himself an &quot;ass&quot; for having apparently been manipulated into
crying. As with Fulvia's death, he uses his favourite onion metaphor to
distance himself from his own tears (4.2.9-24; compare 4.2.35 and
1.2.169-70).</p>
<p>Enobarbus has supported his master's cause energetically while it has a
fair chance of success, and is without doubt deeply affected by his
defeat, but, after remaining loyal for a while thereafter, &quot;though
[his] reason sits in the wind against [him],&quot; he decides that he
cannot, like Antony, allow his &quot;valor&quot; to &quot;prey...on reason&quot; (3.7.1-48,
3.10.15-23, 3.10.34-36, 3.13.3-12, 3.13.194-200). However, the
&quot;reason[able]&quot; calculations which lead to him deserting are entirely
self-regarding and take no account of his affection for Antony: he has
nothing to counterbalance his worry that his master's probable defeat
will deprive him of status, fortune, or indeed life itself except the
reflection that &quot;to follow with allegiance a fall'n lord&quot; is to
&quot;earn...a place i' th' story,&quot; and the rueful acknowledgement that
Caesar generally offers deserters &quot;entertainment, but no honourable
trust&quot; (3.12.43-46, 4.6.10-19). What follows shows Enobarbus and the
reader that &quot;reason&quot; only deserves the name if it takes its bearings by
the substantial satisfactions of constant intimacy.</p>
<p>It is the generosity which Antony shows in returning the faithless
Enobarbus' &quot;treasure, with bounty overplus,&quot; which finally dismantles
the latter's cynical assumption that the world revolves around status
and profit (4.6.19-21). Precisely because Enobarbus has now deserted
Antony's cause, he cannot assume that this magnanimous act is motivated
by self-love, as he did earlier with his master's valedictory speech,
but must see it simply as a tender acknowledgement of a long-standing
friendship (4.2.22-23). His case now resembles that of a recently
orphaned child, who suddenly realises that his proudest victories in the
games that he used to play were really only ever truly enjoyable because
of the unobtrusive presence of his loving parents. Although he phrases
his first response in habitually materialistic terms, declaring, &quot;O
Antony, thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid my better
service,&quot; he knows that the profit which he has forfeited is the
trusting intimacy which he could have enjoyed if he had reciprocated his
master's sympathetic care (4.6.30-33). This generosity &quot;blows [his]
heart,&quot; both in the sense of striking or exploding it and of causing it
to expand or bloom, since he feels the bitterness of his loss at the
same instant as he acknowledges the intensity of his love (4.6.33).</p>
<p>Enobarbus now understands that the only true &quot;nobleness of life,&quot; to use
Antony's phrase, consists in uniting with a beloved in constant
friendship (1.1.33-37). The bitterness of his revulsion against the
self-regard which has deprived him of this good is as unlimited as the
devotion in which it is rooted. He now discards not only his desire for
profit and honour, but even his instinct for self-preservation, that
most deeply rooted manifestation of self-love: not only does he attempt
to give away his treasure to the messenger, but he prays to be disgraced
in the world's &quot;register&quot; as a &quot;master leaver,&quot; after dying in the most
shameful manner, in &quot;some ditch...; the foul'st best fits my latter part
of life&quot; (4.9.18-22, 4.6.36-38). There is no need even to engineer his
own death in any material way, for mere &quot;thought will do't&quot; (4.6.35).
His heart, already &quot;dried with grief,&quot; continuously confronts the fact
that he has forfeited Antony's love as a result of his pride,
&quot;throw[ing]&quot; itself against the flint and hardness of [his]
fault&quot;--until it eventually &quot;break[s] to powder&quot; purely under the
pressure of these &quot;foul thoughts&quot; (4.9.15-18).</p>
<p>Enobarbus' folly is to have disrupted the interchange of trust and
gratitude on which deep attachments are founded. As he now realises,
these can only be sustained by an equitable exchange of self-denying
care: &quot;how wouldst thou have paid my better service&quot; (4.6.30-33).
However, the penance by which Enobarbus attempts to restore this balance
after his egregious perfidy shows that what one might call the
transactions of love take a highly paradoxical form in the deepest
attachments, since the <em>summum bonum</em> of a perfectly harmonious intimacy
demands a devotion which is intransigently self-effacing. The
unobtrusive manner of Eros' and Enobarbus' suicides implies that both
men ultimately prioritise their devotion to Antony over their desire for
a reciprocal care: Eros asks his master to turn his head away before
unexpectedly stabbing himself rather than his master, while Enobarbus'
last two desperate speeches are both soliloquies -there is in fact no
evidence that Antony even hears about his death (4.6.29-38, 4.9.1-33).</p>
<p>Enobarbus knows that to reduce the penance by which he atones for
disrupting the intimacy to a transaction aimed at satisfying his own
needs would further divide him from his beloved. It is for this reason
that Enobarbus can do no more than simply hope against hope that Antony
might be &quot;noble...&quot; enough to &quot;forgive&quot; him thoroughly of his own accord
(4.9.18-20). Enobarbus' guilt is typical of the transactions of deep
love, which, paradoxically, impel lovers to foreground their
unconditional service rather than the sense of intimate connection with
their beloved which is in fact their ultimate objective. Thus, although
the loyal &quot;precedent services&quot; of Eros requite his master for
emancipating him from slavery and are in their turn rewarded by Antony's
absolute trust, while it is the latter's generosity, itself a reward for
Enobarbus' previous &quot;honest[y],&quot; which finally secures the latter's
complete devotion, it is a measure of the truly passionate nature of
these services precisely that they are not conceived of as transactional
by either party, but as unstintingly generous (4.14.77-84, 4.5.16-17).</p>
<p>However, Enobarbus' uncommunicated hope for forgiveness shows that the
self-denying service of passionate lovers does ultimately serve their
interests, since the purpose of eliminating all divisive desires is to
unite with their beloved -although Enobarbus hopes only to go some way
towards restoring his internal sense of connectedness with his friend.
Since the self-denial of lovers is therefore a means to an end, even
though it may present itself as an end in itself, it is not necessarily
limitless. Shakespeare uses Eros' refusal to extend his service to
killing his master, which is motivated by a need to &quot;escape the sorrow
of Antony's death,&quot; rather than by compassion for his master, to show
that even the most intransigently passionate lover's apparently entirely
self-effacing care does in fact have a limit, since it is rooted in the
pursuit of a fulfilment which depends on prioritising the relationship
with the beloved above all other considerations (4.14-89-95). This
incident indicates that this is not quite the same thing as prioritising
sympathetic care for the beloved themselves at all times, although
admittedly these two aims almost always coincide.</p>
<p>In this way, Shakespeare uses Enobarbus to expose the essential nature
of love. If, as the above argument suggests, humble, self-denying
devotion represents the ultimate expression of intense passion, then,
paradoxically, the very abjectness and obscurity of Enobarbus'
repentance and death are signs that he has reached the apex of the
erotic hierarchy which the play implicitly outlines. He is sharply
contrasted with the more self-loving characters in the play, since, far
from exploiting Antony to fuel his self-regard, as both Caesar and
Cleopatra do in their different ways (see below), he implies that the
world's &quot;rank&quot; and &quot;register&quot; would only be of substantial use to him if
they could somehow reflect his passionate guilt at having forfeited his
connection with his beloved &quot;in particular&quot; (4.9.18-22). Enobarbus'
abject humility is thus implicitly offered as the standard by which all
the other, more self-regarding characters in the play may be judged:
ironically, the titanic ambitions that dominate this proto-imperial
world pursue a much less valuable return than the passion which leads to
Enobarbus' abject self-annihilation, since, as we shall see, these
ambitions offer no intrinsic gratification, but depend entirely upon
external validation. The corollary of Enobarbus' epiphany is that those
who devote themselves to such ambitions are, despite appearances, bound
to live starved, stunted lives, since their only substantial reward will
be &quot;clay [and] dungy earth&quot; (1.1.35). By contrast with Caesar,
Enobarbus understands in the end that the only truly fulfilling form of
&quot;possess[ion]&quot; is the sense of unity with his beloved which he could
have gained by sacrificing his desire for status and remaining loyal to
Antony (2.7.101).</p>
<p>This is not to deny that Enobarbus' previous characteristic scepticism
may be a prudent stance to adopt in the fickle world of power politics,
which, as we shall see, is dominated by ambitious characters whose
calculating self-love is by no means subordinated to their passionate
attachments. Quite apart from the naivety of Antony's trust in Cleopatra
(see below), the passionate, but undiscriminating Eros, whose name
implies that he encapsulates the strengths and weaknesses of
intransigent passion, pities the queen deeply when she is merely staging
one of her many 'deaths,' while Dolabella assumes that she is mourning
for Antony, when, as we shall see, her real concern is to find out from
him whether she will be led in triumph (3.11.46-48, 5.2.71-110). By
contrast, as we have seen, Enobarbus never allows his own fascination
with the queen to soften his sardonic attitude to her &quot;becomings&quot;
(1.2.140-51). On the other hand, Dolabella is prepared to risk incurring
Caesar's wrath to help Cleopatra, while Eros' suicide shows that, unlike
Enobarbus, his self-love has always been regulated by his passionate
attachments. The contrasting strengths and weaknesses displayed by Eros
and Enobarbus point to the inherent tension between prudence and erotic
constancy, and imply that, in political situations at least, passionate
characters need to acquire a capacity for discrimination, while ensuring
that their ardent desires are not stunted, as could be said of Enobarbus
himself prior to his desertion, by the acquisition of a quality which is
so antithetical to their underlying nature. Although we do not see
Enobarbus live to combine an Eros-like constancy with his habitual
shrewdness, the play could be seen as pointing towards such a synthesis.</p>
<h1>Caesar</h1>
<p>Caesar's disapproval of drunkenness, and indeed any form of levity, is a
sign that he engages in relationships only when they might help him to
&quot;possess&quot; the time, rather than as an end in themselves (2.7.101). At
the party hosted by Pompey, Caesar is too concerned with maintaining his
dignity to become involved in the spontaneous camaraderie which the wine
encourages, whereas Enobarbus, whom he sees only as &quot;weaker&quot; as a result
of his inebriation, becomes &quot;a child o' th' time,&quot; as he dances with his
&quot;brave emperor&quot; (2.7.94-125). If we take our bearings by the dying
Enobarbus, who realises that such intimate moments with Antony are worth
far more than his pride, we can infer that it is in fact the dignified
Caesar who is in a sense the &quot;weaker&quot; character in this scene rather
than those who have allowed themselves to be &quot;antick'd&quot; by &quot;the wild
disguise&quot; of drink -although of course he would be the one best able to
defend himself, if Menas has his way (2.7.124-125, 2.7.66-73). His
criticism of the revellers exposes the disjunction between the demands
of the erotic and the political sphere.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Caesar wishes to &quot;possess&quot; the &quot;time&quot; in order to gain both
prestige in his own life-time and posthumous fame: he invites his
followers to see &quot;in all [his] writings&quot; how &quot;hardly he was drawn into
this war&quot; and how &quot;calm and gentle [he] proceeded&quot; (2.7.101,
5.1.73-77). He plans a &quot;solemn show&quot; for Antony and Cleopatra's funeral,
because &quot;their story is no less in pity than his glory which brought
them to be lamented&quot; (5.2.361-66). Caesar is thus contrasted to
Enobarbus in an almost schematic way: whereas Enobarbus wants to die
abjectly to punish himself for prioritising prestige over a truly
fulfilling friendship, Caesar consistently prioritises fame over
personal attachments. Shakespeare obliquely indicates the
insubstantiality of &quot;glory&quot; by reminding us that it depends on evoking
the admiration of others: Caesar, who does not normally waste words,
invites &quot;all&quot; his followers twice to &quot;go with [him],&quot; and see what he
has written in the episode quoted above (5.1.73-77). As the archetypal
politician, he is entirely reliant on the affirmation of others, whereas
the dying Enobarbus knows that friendship has provided him with a solid,
intrinsic joy, which exists regardless of the world's &quot;register&quot;
(4.9.22). As we have seen, Enobarbus does not even need Antony to know
that he has died for his death to play a meaningful role in his
relationship with his friend.</p>
<p>Caesar speaks more truly than he knows when he declares that it is not
his &quot;natural vice to hate&quot; Antony (1.4.2-3). He seems angry with Antony
at the start of the play, but in fact his criticism is purely a way of
establishing a public justification for the war which he plans to wage
against his rival: &quot;You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know...&quot;
(1.4.1-33). As soon he realises that he needs Antony to help him to
defeat Pompey, he launches into an extended eulogy of his legendary
toughness, in which he shamelessly contradicts his previous excoriation
of his rival's decadence (1.4.3-71). Indeed, neither his love nor his
hate is &quot;natural,&quot; since he views almost all his relationships purely as
instruments to further his ambitions: as we have seen, he cannot
understand why Antony should &quot;give a kingdom for a mirth,&quot; or
&quot;tippl[e] with a slave,&quot; or &quot;stand the buffet with knaves&quot; (1.4.18-21;
see also 2.7.98-125). Whereas Antony allows Enobarbus to interrupt in a
passionate and unruly manner with no more than a mild reprimand, Caesar
has clearly primed Agrippa to propose the arranged marriage with Octavia
as soon as he has been given his cue, so that he himself can avoid
losing face were Antony to refuse his offer (2.2.103-38). He offers his
sister, whom he claims &quot;no brother did ever love so dearly,&quot; in marriage
to a man who loves another woman, and who will, as Enobarbus says,
inevitably &quot;wrangle&quot; with him in the end, purely in order to cement the
alliance which is needed to defeat Pompey (2.2.148-52). Although he
weeps as he is bidding farewell to her, partly no doubt because he knows
how her marriage is likely to end, he shamelessly uses her return to
Rome, despite all her protests, to represent her as &quot;abus'd&quot; and his
army as &quot;ministers&quot; of the gods, appointed &quot;to do [her] justice&quot;
(3.6.39-90).</p>
<p>Whereas both Antony and Pompey are temporarily distracted from their
prudent understanding that the treaty which they ultimately sign is in
their own political interest by their noble and passionate constancy,
which leads the latter to express anger over both the death of his
father and the end of the republic, and the former to respond in an
equally defiant manner, Caesar simply ignores this heated exchange, safe
in the knowledge that the logic of power politics is on his side
(2.6.8-42). He also ignores the two men's efforts to patch up an old
friendship, in which Pompey's ongoing generosity has clearly earned
Antony's gratitude (2.6.42-52; see also 2.2.153-57, 2.7.126-28). Whereas
Pompey is sincere when he insists that &quot;Fortune&quot; will never make his
&quot;heart her vassal,&quot; Caesar may use the language of honourable constancy
when it is useful--as when he announces to Antony that he has never
&quot;broken the article of [his] oath&quot; (2.2.81-83)--but in practice he
simply pursues power and profit in the most prudent and efficient manner
possible (2.5.53-56, 2.1.13-14). Although the portrayal of Pompey shows
that politicians and their supporters may certainly be moved by
patriotism and piety to work for the public good--especially, it is
implied in republics--Shakespeare's decision to set his play during the
chaotic, transitional period between the republic and the Roman empire
allows him to demonstrate that in this political state of nature, those
who pursue power with a clear-sighted, wily prudence will inevitably
come to dominate.</p>
<p>The contrasting fortunes of Caesar and Pompey expose the remorseless
logic of the political world. Pompey's passionate and noble effort to
restore the &quot;beauteous freedom&quot; of the republic and to avenge his
father's death wins him public support, as we have seen, but his belief
that he will prevail simply through this groundswell of patriotism, and
because the &quot;great gods...shall assist the deeds of justest men,&quot; is
ultimately shown to be naïve (2.6.8-23, 2.1.1-2, 2.1.50, 2.1.8-10).
Despite his noble rhetoric, he knows that Caesar's prudent rapprochement
with Antony has enabled the allies to rival him at sea and &quot;o'ercount&quot;
him by land, and so in the end tamely submits to an agreement which
leaves him controlling only Sicily and Sardinia, in return for sending
tribute to Rome (2.6.8-39).</p>
<p>Caesar's willingness to subordinate both passion and honour to the
pursuit of power gives him the advantage over all his rivals. Whereas
Caesar promptly betrays Lepidus after using him to defeat Pompey, and
has him executed, all the while disguising this ruthlessness under a
show of legality in characteristic fashion, Pompey's fate is ultimately
sealed by his noble decision to reject Menas' plan to murder his
political rivals all at once after trapping them on his ship: Pompey
declares, &quot;'tis not my profit that doth lead mine honor; mine honor,
it,&quot; and sees Antony as a&quot;friend...,&quot; while admitting that, &quot;being done
unknown, I should have found it afterwards well done, but must condemn
it now&quot; (3.5.7-12, 2.7.70-84). The even more passionate Antony goes
further, and &quot;threats the throat of that his officer that murd'red
Pompey,&quot; even though the deed was indeed &quot;done unknown&quot; to him -although
the implication is that, despite his genuine anger, he will not in the
end carry out these &quot;threats,&quot; since the murder has undoubtedly
benefited him politically (3.5.18-19). Overall, we can infer from these
intricate parallels and contrasts that both passionate attachments and
the code of honour represent a major handicap in the political world,
since they prevent Caesar's rivals from matching his single-minded
ruthlessness.</p>
<p>Whereas Antony takes up Caesar's challenge to fight by sea--which the
latter delivers purely because this is where his strength lies--partly
because he &quot;dares us to't,&quot; but mainly because this is Cleopatra's will
(3.7.7-69), Caesar himself is prudent rather than nobly or passionately
courageous, and would not dream of allowing himself to be goaded into
single combat &quot;against a sworder&quot; by Antony's taunts of cowardice
(3.11.35-40, 3.13.20-37). This prudent disregard for honour and passion
is in reality what allows Caesar to &quot;o'erpow'r&quot; Antony's &quot;noble,
courageous, high unmatchable&quot; spirit, just in the way that the
soothsayer predicts (2.3.20-24). Caesar's wiliness is shown by the
unexpected speed of his advance, which was achieved through &quot;such
distractions as beguil'd all spies;&quot; by his efforts to induce Cleopatra
to betray or kill Antony; by his decision to &quot;plant those that have
revolted in the van,&quot; so as to dishearten Antony's troops; and by his
attempt, albeit abortive, to use Dolabella, Proculeius, who has fooled
Antony into believing that he is an ally, and finally his own calming
words, to manipulate the queen into being led in triumph (3.7.20-23,
3.7.75-77, 3.12.20-24, 4.6.7-9, 4.15.47-48, 5.1.61-68, 5.2.117-91).</p>
<p>However, although Caesar is easily the most successful political leader
in the play, his coolly prudential approach has its disadvantages, as he
&quot;gets money where he loses hearts&quot; (2.1.13-14). By contrast, Pompey's
naval strength stems from the fact that &quot;he is belov'd of those that
only have fear'd Caesar;&quot; a love that is in part clearly an expression
of patriotism and a desire to restore Rome's &quot;beauteous freedom&quot;
(1.4.36-38, 2.1.8-11, 2.6.17). Where constant attachments are not
degraded by the political world, they can often be used to advance a
political cause, precisely because, as Enobarbus' death shows, they are
ultimately stronger than self-love. Just after Enobarbus has decided to
desert, we are led to believe that &quot;the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd,
now leaves him&quot; (4.3.16-17; see 1.3.84 and 4.12.43-45 for the parallels
between Antony himself and Hercules, from whom the former claimed
descent). Before his desertion Enobarbus was indeed Herculean in his
loyalty: he strove vigorously to prevent Cleopatra from becoming
involved in the war and to oppose Antony fighting by sea, and, despite
being a hardened soldier, is so &quot;sicken[ed] at the sight&quot; of his
master's subsequent defeat that he admits twice that he cannot bear to
watch (3.7.1-19, 3.7.34-40, 3.10.1-4, 3.10.15-17). He resembles the
anonymous soldier, who swears &quot;by Hercules&quot; after failing to persuade
his &quot;noble Emperor&quot; to fight by land (3.7.61-67).</p>
<p>The genuine personal affection which Antony feels for many of his
followers has inspired a corresponding loyalty which allows him to
retain much of his army even after his initial defeat: after shaking
five of them by the hand, he declares a wish that &quot;all of you [were]
clapp'd up together in an Antony, that I might do you service so good as
you have done,&quot; and, as we have seen, they weep in response, no doubt
while vowing eternal loyalty to their master (4.2.10-19, 4.2.33-36). The
next battle is won against the odds, precisely through the personal
devotion of Antony's followers: &quot;you...have fought not as you serv'd the
cause, but as't had been each man's like mine&quot; (4.8.5-7). As with the
Hercules image, Shakespeare hints at the transcendent force of this
devotion by figuring it as divine: Scarus has &quot;fought to-day as if a
god...had destroyed in such a shape&quot; (4.8.24-26). By contrast, Dolabella
sees no pressing reason to help Caesar to lead Cleopatra in triumph,
after feeling the queen's grief in a way that &quot;smites [his] very heart
at root&quot; (5.2.100-10). Dolabella's successful deception of Caesar hints
that the ruthless ambition which characterises the political world,
especially in this proto-imperial age, will always be undermined by an
unobtrusive residue of passionate feeling: he remains in his master's
confidence at the end of the play, and even allows himself to gloat
surreptitiously over the fact that he gave Cleopatra the information
which drives her to &quot;perform...the dreaded act which [Caesar] so
sought...to hinder&quot; (5.2.329-32). Having said all this, although a
charismatic ability to inspire passionate loyalty may confer enormous
power, Caesar's ultimate annihilation of both Pompey and Antony implies
that, in the political sphere at least, cool, fickle prudence will tend
ultimately to dominate -which is not to deny that the most powerful
leaders of all might possibly be able to combine these two contrasting
qualities.</p>
<p>From the broadest point of view, however, Caesar is a pitiable figure,
since the prestige that he pursues is not of intrinsic benefit, but
depends on his sense of his own superiority, as affirmed by the
adulation of his subjects. Moreover, in order to &quot;possess&quot; the world, he
must cease to &quot;be a child o' th' time,&quot; detaching himself from the
intimate exchanges which could offer him a truly substantial
satisfaction.</p>
<h1>Cleopatra</h1>
<p>Cleopatra's attachment to Antony is stunted by her self-regard: her
opening question shows that she is focusing on the devotion which she
receives from him-- &quot;If it be love indeed, tell me how much&quot;
(1.1.13)--whereas lovers who wish to establish a deep rapport with their
beloveds naturally concentrate on offering, rather than demanding,
self-denying care, as is suggested by Antony's determination to
prioritise his love over his political power: &quot;Here is my space,
kingdoms are clay&quot; (1.1.33-37). Moreover, the shallowness of Cleopatra's
affection is exposed by her very desire to &quot;set a bourn how far to be
belov'd,&quot; as Antony inadvertently acknowledges when he declares that
&quot;there's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd&quot; (1.1.14-17). By
contrast, Antony's own great vow of loyalty suggests that the intimacy
which devoted lovers experience is literally beyond comparison because
it constitutes the ultimate good, the only true &quot;nobleness of life&quot;:</p>
<p>Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch</p>
<p>Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space,</p>
<p>Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike</p>
<p>Feeds beast as man; the nobleness of life</p>
<p>Is to do thus [embracing].</p>
<p>(1.1.33-37)</p>
<p>Whereas Antony makes a sharp distinction between the substantial joy
which he derives from his attachment and the illusory benefits of
political status, Cleopatra implicitly assumes that the two are
comparable. (By drawing an extended contrast between the two in the
speech quoted above, Antony seemingly acknowledges that this is indeed
her assumption, even as he rejects it out of hand.) This suggests that
the queen values Antony's love simply because it provides her with a
more intense version of the adulation which she receives from her
subjects (see for instance 2.2.211-14). She is gratified, not by the
intimacy that she might share with her lover in itself, but by the
distinction which Antony confers on her by valuing her above his grander
concerns. As in the case of political status, however, this distinction
is not intrinsically pleasurable, since it may only be savoured by
contemplating the value which Antony places on his love relative to
these other concerns, precisely as the queen is endeavouring to do in
the conversation under discussion. Moreover, not only does Cleopatra's
self-regard provide her with no substantial benefits, while preventing
her from offering the self-denying care which could generate a lasting
intimacy, but, as her repeated questions also imply, it also leaves her
uncertain as to the extent of Antony's loyalty: she has no more trust in
her lover's willingness to subordinate his self-love to the attachment
than she has a capacity to do so herself.</p>
<p>Cleopatra has certainly become famous through her relationship with
Antony: Maecenas and Agrippa are eager to pump Enobarbus for an account
of her beauty, her extravagant hospitality and the couple's initial
meeting, and prompt him with details which suggest that the romance has
been widely discussed in Rome (2.2.176-89). Cleopatra evidently courts
such notoriety: her initial encounter with Antony is designed to be a
spectacular event-- &quot;the city cast her people out upon her&quot;--and she
sometimes hops in the most charming manner &quot;through the public street&quot;
(2.213-18, 2.2.228-32). It is clearly important to her that Alexas has
noticed the unnecessarily &quot;thick&quot; stream of &quot;twenty several messengers&quot;
which she has sent to Antony (1.5.61-65). Similarly, Cleopatra and her
sons are &quot;publicly enthron'd&quot; in &quot;th' common show-place, where they
exercise,&quot; with the queen dressed as &quot;the goddess Isis,&quot; in which
costume she &quot;oft before gave audience&quot; (3.6.3-19). There is no doubt
that she is attracted to Antony partly because of the political power
which he delegates to her and her children-- &quot;realms and islands were as
plates dropp'd from his pocket&quot;--which allows her to execute kings at
will and to insist on fighting at Actium &quot;as the president of [the]
kingdom&quot; (1.5.43-61, 3.3.4-6, 3.7.15-19).</p>
<p>However, there is much evidence to suggest that it is Antony himself who
is the primary source of the adulation which Cleopatra craves, rather
than the power that he invests in her. Thus, she is too concerned to
establish the loyalty of her errant lover as he travels to Rome even to
respond to Alexas' declaration that his master intends to make her queen
of &quot;all the East&quot; (1.5.43-61). She undoubtedly relishes the numerous
secondary benefits which he provides, but, as we shall see, she
understands that her lover can offer a much more intense and consistent
level of adoration than could be supplied by public acclaim. It is for
this reason, rather than because of any sense of sympathetic intimacy,
that she misses him so desperately after his departure for Rome: she
&quot;think[s] of him too much&quot; according to Charmian, and simply wishes to
&quot;sleep out this great gap of time my Antony is away&quot; (1.5.1-6). She
values above all her sense that she is &quot;mov[ing]&quot; a great ruler when
they embrace, just as she imagines that her lover's horse is
distinguished by the fact that it &quot;bear[s] the...demi-Atlas of this
earth, the arm and burgonet of men&quot; (1.5.21-24). After his death she
claims that she is driven by &quot;such poor passion as the maid that milks,&quot;
but then proceeds to eulogise Antony as the &quot;noblest of men...the crown
o' th' earth...the garland of the war...the soldier's pole&quot; (5.1.63-75).
His awesome power-- &quot;his legs bestrid the ocean, his rear'd arm crested
the world&quot;--is significant to her primarily because of the gratifying
distinction he made between his enemies, whom he addressed in a voice of
&quot;thunder,&quot; and his friends--in other words, herself--to whom he spoke as
mellifluously as the &quot;tuned spheres&quot; (5.2.82-86). Similarly, she does
not celebrate &quot;his delights&quot; just for themselves, but because they
distinguished him in relation to his companions: they &quot;were
dolphin-like, they show'd his back above the element they liv'd in&quot;
(5.2.88-90).</p>
<p>Cleopatra's musings on her previous conquests support Charmian's
bantering insistence that she has desired other political leaders as
intensely as her current lover (1.5.29-34, 1.5.66-73). Antony is only
the latest of a series of &quot;demi-Atlas[es]&quot; whom she has captivated:
the queen recalls being &quot;a morsel&quot; for Julius Caesar and then an object
of intense desire for old Pompey, who &quot;would stand and make his eyes
grow in my brow...and die with looking on his life&quot; (1.5.23-34).
Cleopatra's love is indeed generic, since she wishes above all to be
distinguished by the adoring attentions of the most powerful lover
possible: the greater his power, the greater the distinction of being
valued above his political ambitions. Having no conception of the
intimacy that can be generated through mutual sympathy and care,
Cleopatra is concerned with Antony's real feelings only insofar as they
seem to facilitate or thwart the gratification of this desire. She would
clearly prefer her lover to be &quot;sad&quot; after his departure for Rome, but
nevertheless takes his reported calmness as evidence that he is
concealing his &quot;remembrance&quot; of her in order to boost his followers'
morale, thus reassuring herself as to her own continuing influence over
such a charismatic leader (1.5.49-61). This forced interpretation of
Antony's impassive behaviour provides a strong hint that she tends to
reduce the people around her to ciphers onto which she projects her
intransigent pride. All the implications are that Cleopatra's capacity
to form sympathetic attachments has been degraded by her royal status:
surrounded by servants and slaves ministering to her every whim, she has
been encouraged to give free rein to her self-regard (2.2.201-08).</p>
<p>Cleopatra's habitually domineering approach frequently forces her
interlocutors to conceal their real views. Her semi-serious threats to
&quot;chok[e]&quot; even Charmian, who is her most intimate and outspoken
confidante, and to give her &quot;bloody teeth&quot; for playfully reminding her
that she used to speak of Julius Caesar so admiringly, can easily give
way to direct commands for her to remain silent: &quot;pity me, but do not
speak to me&quot; (1.5.68-72, 2.5.18-19). The messenger whom she beats, and
then threatens with death for informing her of Antony's marriage,
initially flees from her and is not only &quot;afeard to come&quot; back, but is,
understandably, both nervous and resentful when he finally agrees to do
so (2.5.57-101). His reaction illustrates Charmian's warning, that &quot;in
time we hate that which we often fear&quot; (1.3.12; see below). When the
messenger reappears, he is too &quot;afeard&quot; to tell the truth, and thus
needs only a little prompting to tell his &quot;dread queen&quot; that Octavia
&quot;creeps,&quot; and further, as he warms to his task, that she is more like &quot;a
statue, than a breather&quot; that her face is &quot;round, even to faultiness,&quot;
and &quot;her forehead [is] as low as she would wish it&quot; (3.3.1-34). The
suggestion that the queen might reward him sexually for these flattering
lies and half-truths--she demands to see him privately in order to ask
him &quot;one&quot; unspecified &quot;thing more&quot;--underlines the implicit parallel
between this &quot;proper man,&quot; who has shown that he appreciates Cleopatra's
true &quot;majesty&quot; by appeasing her so carefully, and Antony himself
(3.3.38-48). Antony too habitually conciliates the queen, but, as we
shall see, at the expense of repressing his underlying distrust and
resentment, which he subsequently vents in spasms of savage anger, just
in the way that Charmian predicted he would.</p>
<p>Early on in the play, Charmian's advice to her mistress indicates the
standpoint from which Cleopatra's habitual motives and tactics should be
judged. When the queen learns that Antony is intending to go to Rome,
she orders Charmian to tell him that she is &quot;dancing&quot; if he is &quot;sad,&quot;
but &quot;sudden sick&quot; if he is &quot;in mirth&quot;: presumably, if he is &quot;sad,&quot; she
will know that he cares about her and so can pretend to be indifferent,
which would carry an implicit threat that he might lose her if he were
to depart, but conversely, if he is glad to be going, her principal
effort would be to disarm him by appealing to his pity and guilt
(1.3.2-5). As we have seen, however, Charmian warns her at this point
that &quot;in time we hate that which we often fear,&quot; declaring that if she
&quot;did love him dearly, she should &quot;give him way, cross him in nothing,&quot;
rather than attempting to &quot;enforce the like from him&quot; (1.3.6-12). Her
implication is that a true lover would strive to sympathise with the
concerns which are driving Antony back to Rome, since trust can only be
won through generous, self-denying service.</p>
<p>Cleopatra's blunt rejection of this advice-- &quot;Thou teachest like a fool:
the way to lose him&quot; (1.3.10)--reflects her belief that Antony's love is
bound to be inconstant, unless sustained by her manipulations, since,
judging him by her own standards, she assumes that it is rooted in
self-love. As we shall see, instead of showing him sympathetic care by
restraining her possessiveness and prioritising his security--which
clearly requires a &quot;quick remove&quot; to Rome (1.2.99-111, 1.2.179-94)-- she
tries to manipulate him into staying by playing on his fears in a
variety of cunning ways. Ironically, considering her overweening sense
of her own dignity, the queen's overall aim is therefore from one point
of view pitiably unambitious compared to that of a truly erotic lover:
she cannot yet appreciate Antony's desire to enshrine his devotion as a
ruling passion, or reciprocate in a manner that might facilitate a
trusting intimacy, which would in fact be far more fulfilling than the
distinction of being adored by him. Such an intimacy would render her
manipulations redundant, as Charmian seems to realise, and would sustain
itself naturally, regardless of her lover's physical location.</p>
<p>The two opening conversations between the eponymous lovers illustrate
Cleopatra's priorities and tactics in detail, especially when considered
in conjunction with Charmian's advice. At first, the queen manages to
goad Antony into making the passionate vow of loyalty quoted above by
insisting vehemently that he obey Caesar's &quot;dismission&quot; and &quot;Fulvia's
scolds&quot; (1.1.55-85). When he subsequently reneges on this vow, she
declares that she is &quot;sick&quot;--presumably, according to the rule outlined
above, on the basis that he seems more content to leave than &quot;sad&quot;--and
attempts to shame him both for his uxorious obedience and, in a
shamelessly contradictory manner, for his fickleness and insincerity
(1.3.13-85). When, however, Antony proves merely to be angered by this
onslaught, and abruptly declares that he will &quot;leave,&quot; Cleopatra is
unexpectedly forced to shift her ground. Partly no doubt to give herself
time to think, she then presents herself as feeling so stunned by a blow
which, despite her lover's assurances, she pretends to view as
irreversible, that she loses her thread: &quot;my oblivion is a very Antony,
and I am all forgotten&quot; (1.3.86-91). This quickly improvised appeal is
cunningly multi-levelled: not only does she portray herself as too
wretched to assemble her thoughts, and simultaneously reproach her lover
for his hard-heartedness in forgetting her, but, just as Enobarbus
predicted, she begins to hint darkly that she might herself soon seek a
permanent &quot;oblivion&quot; if she were to be abandoned (1.3.90-93,
1.2.140-44).</p>
<p>Cleopatra's reference to being &quot;all forgotten&quot; signals a change in tack:
from now on her main effort is to appeal to her lover's sense of pity.
However, armed by Enobarbus' advice, Antony finally manages to resist a
tactic which his friend implies has been successful many times in the
past (1.2.140-51). Thus, the queen is finally driven by Antony's
obduracy to adopt the desperate course of actually confessing to her
&quot;becomings&quot; --to use her own insouciant term for her machinations--and
promising to discard them, since they do not &quot;eye well with&quot; him
(1.3.91-97). She now claims to be speaking sincerely for the first time
to a lover who, she announces, with a fair approximation to passion,
occupies a place &quot;near [her] heart.&quot; What follows, however, is
precisely the sort of emotional blackmail which Enobarbus predicted: she
declares that he &quot;kill[s]&quot; her when he is displeased with her, and
goes on to urge him histrionically to &quot;be deaf to [her] unpitied
folly&quot; as he departs (1.3.96-98). Thus, this final moment of 'sincerity'
turns out simply to be the most disarming of the &quot;becomings&quot; through
which she still hopes ultimately to impose her will. Overall, although
Cleopatra can imitate passionate sincerity, her early speeches are
invariably power moves, since she is not actually aiming to establish an
intimate rapport, which, as we have seen, must be founded on sympathetic
care, but to reinforce her self-regard by securing Antony's continuing
adulation. As Charmian realises, she plays on a variety of fears, the
most effective of which is her lover's fear of losing her.</p>
<p>Insofar as Cleopatra is attracted to Antony, rather than simply
concerned to gratify her self-regard, her needs are primarily sensual:
after admitting that she envies the &quot;happy horse [which] bear[s] the
weight of Antony,&quot; she declares that she &quot;take[s] no pleasure in aught
an eunuch has,&quot; thus inadvertently admitting that she is a stranger to
&quot;fierce affections&quot; such as Mardian feels, which cannot be satisfied
sexually (1.5.21, 1.5.9-18). However, even her sensual desire is
subordinated to her cool determination to exploit her desirability.
Enobarbus, who is himself by no means immune to her charm, verifies how
forcefully and determinedly she &quot;hits the sense[s]&quot; of taste, smell,
touch, hearing and sight through a &quot;monstrous matter of feast,&quot;
&quot;strange, invisible perfume,&quot; &quot;the touches of...flower-soft hands,&quot; &quot;the
tune of flutes,&quot; and, most crucially, &quot;her own person,&quot; which
&quot;o'er-picture[s]...Venus&quot; (2.2.212, 2.2.182, 2.2.191-212). Although
her only weapon is her sexual attraction, she resembles Caesar in that
she has marshalled her powers over the years with military efficiency.</p>
<p>Cleopatra inadvertently admits that she was &quot;cold in blood&quot; even in her
&quot;salad days,&quot; when passions are usually at their most intense
(1.5.25-28). She is regularly associated with creatures that are &quot;cold
in blood&quot;: immediately after recalling that Antony calls her his
&quot;serpent of old Nile,&quot; she &quot;feed[s] [her]self with most delicious
poison&quot;--as she savours the influence which she has exerted over a
series of great rulers--in a manner that associates her with the asps
which eventually kill her (1.5.25-34). According to Cleopatra's own
conceit, which Charmian unwittingly develops, she has in effect
&quot;betray[ed],&quot; or tricked Antony into desiring her, just as
&quot;tawny-finn'd fishes&quot; are &quot;pierce[d]&quot; with a baited, &quot;bended hook,&quot;
while offering him in return only a &quot;salt-fish,&quot; which he is fooled into
retrieving &quot;with fervency&quot; (2.5.10-18). The implicit comparison of the
queen to a dead &quot;salt-fish&quot; places her at three removes from
warm-bloodedness: she is not only a fish, but lifeless, and not only
lifeless, but artificially preserved over a long period. Significantly,
rather than herself submitting to the passionate effects of music,
&quot;moody food of us who trade in love,&quot; as she is for a moment tempted to
do, she orders it to be played at a distance while she fishes, in order
to disarm the prey that she hopes to &quot;betray&quot; (2.5.1-12). All of this
suggests that Enobarbus is correct to declare that Antony &quot;pays his
heart for what his eyes eat only,&quot; since Cleopatra is indeed incapable
of returning his &quot;fervency&quot; (2.2.225-26).</p>
<p>Cleopatra worries that Antony's love will be fleeting because, judging
by her own standards, she assumes at first, not only that it is
fundamentally self-regarding, but that it is primarily a physical
appetite. For this reason, she fears the inevitable decline of her
beauty, as is reflected in the contrast between her voluble criticisms
of Octavia's &quot;height,&quot; &quot;gait,&quot; &quot;years,&quot; &quot;face,&quot; &quot;hair&quot; and voice and her
silence when informed that her rival is thirty (3.3.11-34). She is
concerned that Antony might be repelled by the knowledge that she is
&quot;wrinkled deep in time&quot; and &quot;black&quot; with the &quot;amorous pinches&quot; of her
multiple ardent lovers as well as those of Phoebus -the sun is
frequently associated by Shakespeare with sexual desire (1.5.27-29).
This is no doubt why she uses so much perfume and employs artificial
aids to make her cheeks &quot;glow&quot; (2.2.193, 2.2.203-04, 2.2.212). Antony
knows her well enough to attack her where she is most vulnerable: in his
two great rages he reminds her of her long sexual history and prays that
Octavia might &quot;plough [her] visage up with her prepared nails&quot;
(3.13.116-22, 4.12.37-39)</p>
<p>Cleopatra also knows that even the most vigorous physical desire is
necessarily diminished by the very consummation which it pursues. As
well as enabling her to control her lovers in a general way, Cleopatra's
systematic contrariness therefore serves a very specific purpose: by
repeatedly thwarting the very desire which she provokes, she ensures
that, whereas &quot;other women cloy the appetites they feed... she makes
hungry where most she satisfies&quot; (2.2.335-37). When, at the start of the
play, Antony, &quot;stirr'd&quot; by &quot;the love of Love, and her soft hours,&quot; asks,
&quot;What sport tonight!&quot; Cleopatra quickly assures him that there may be
none at all unless he &quot;hear[s] the ambassadors&quot; (1.1.43-48). Although
in this case, she is practising reverse psychology, since she really
wants him to dismiss the messengers, this implicit threat shows that she
is in the habit of frustrating his sexual desire. It is significant that
her first impulse after learning of Antony's decision to depart is to
withhold her body, telling him to &quot;stand further from&quot; her (1.3.18). She
recalls at one point how she &quot;laugh'd him out of patience; and that
night...laugh'd him into patience,&quot; but then the next morning again
rendered him powerless, symbolically emasculating him by dressing him in
her own &quot;tires and mantles,&quot; while herself wearing his sword
(2.5.19-23). Thus, Antony finds himself serving in rapid succession as
both &quot;the bellows and the fan to cool a gipsy's lust,&quot; as Cleopatra
alternates between apparent ardour and frigidity (1.1.9). Her
characteristic combination of apparent warmth and inner coolness in her
dealings with the opposite sex is foreshadowed in her initial encounter
with Antony, at which she has arranged to be fanned by &quot;pretty dimpled
boys, like smiling Cupids,&quot; who &quot;seem to glow the delicate cheeks which
they did cool, and what they undid did&quot; (2.2.201-05).</p>
<p>Although the queen is no doubt correct in her belief that intense sexual
desire will gradually fade unless it is sporadically frustrated, she is,
however, mistaken in her minor premise; namely that her lover's desire
for her is primarily physical and ultimately subordinated to his pride.
As we have seen, she cannot understand at first that Antony is deeply
attached to her as well as physically attracted, or that his devotion is
therefore inherently constant, just as he maintains in the great oath of
loyalty quoted above (1.1.33-37; see below for a fuller analysis of
Antony's love). Ironically, the queen's programme of provocative
frustration inevitably thwarts her lover's staunch devotion along with
his lust: he wants to &quot;wander through the streets&quot; companionably with
her before they go to bed together, but is, as always, uncertain of her
response - &quot;Come my queen, last night you did desire it&quot; (1.1.53-55).
The slightly plaintive tone of this plea suggests that, although
Cleopatra's unpredictability is designed to prolong the relationship, it
actually weakens the trust on which an enduring intimacy must be
founded; a trust which, as Charmian points out, can only be cemented by
unstinting sympathetic care (1.3.11-12).</p>
<p>Cleopatra's response to Antony's decline and death allows the reader to
gauge the extent and nature of her constancy. At first her involvement
in the battle of Actium seems designed purely to show how her self-love
prevents her from offering her lover reliable support: her proud
determination to be involved in the battle, &quot;as the president of my
kingdom,&quot; forces Antony to fight by sea, even though his &quot;ships are not
well mann'd,&quot; while her subsequent flight shows that she instinctively
prioritises self-preservation over her lover's best interests (3.7.1-48,
3.10.9-23). There is evidence that Antony is in fact mistaken when he
declares, &quot;thou knew'st too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by th'
strings,&quot; and &quot;o'er my spirit thy full supremacy thou knew'st,&quot; for
Cleopatra effectively acknowledges that she does not actually understand
the self-denying devotion which drove him to accompany her as she fled:
&quot;I little thought you would have followed&quot; (3.11.55-61). It is typical
of her, moreover, that she does not &quot;go to him&quot; and &quot;comfort him&quot; after
his defeat, as her attendants entreat her to do, but rather manipulates
him into kissing and forgiving her by fainting as she &quot;approaches&quot; him,
as if &quot;death will seize her&quot; (3.11.1-48). Moreover, even her repeated
apologies seem to be a calculated tactic, designed to confirm that she
is completely &quot;forgive[n]&quot; for her &quot;fearful sails,&quot; since she attempts
to justify her behaviour as soon as she is away from her lover: &quot;Is
Antony or we in fault for this?&quot; (3.13.2, 3.11.55, 3.11.61, 3.11.68). By
contrast with Enobarbus, Cleopatra is content with what I will argue is
a superficial forgiveness on Antony's part, since she does not
understand trusting intimacy, but merely longs to be distinguished by
her lover's care. Despite the couple's facile reconciliation, this
episode, combined with Cleopatra's history of manipulative &quot;wrangling,&quot;
prepares the way for Antony's great rages, which ultimately destroy the
relationship.</p>
<p>However, there is also evidence that Antony's patent willingness to give
up half the world for love finally compels Cleopatra to recognise the
extent of his devotion, and ultimately to abandon her &quot;becomings&quot; and
&quot;wrangling,&quot; since these were always predicated on the assumption that
his primary motives were pride and sexual desire. Not only are her
repeated apologies for fleeing the battle uncharacteristically humble,
even if they are self-regarding in the manner described above, but from
now on her approach is consistently much more conciliatory than at the
start of the play. As we shall see, she moderates her self-assertion and
generally presents a fair approximation of passionate, self-denying
constancy in an effort to encourage her lover to sustain his
unexpectedly extreme devotion. This is not to deny that she only changes
strategy because she now realises that the depth of Antony's love is
such that it could gratify her self-love even more deeply than she had
previously imagined: it is clear from the elegiac speech quoted above
that she is still primarily concerned with the distinction which
Antony's adoration afforded her even at the end of the play (5.2.76-92).
Nevertheless, after the battle of Actium the queen could be said to move
up a level in the erotic hierarchy which the play implicitly outlines,
since she remains loyal until she knows that he is dying (see below).</p>
<p>Thus, Cleopatra is not tempted when Caesar offers her &quot;principalities&quot;
in return for Antony's &quot;grizzled head&quot; (3.13.17-19; see also
3.12.16-24). If she were seriously thinking of betraying Antony, she
certainly would not insist so decisively that not only her own
attendants, but the apparently robustly loyal Enobarbus remain present
while she declares to Thidias that her &quot;honor was not yielded, but
conquer'd merely&quot; (3.13.46-52). She assumes that Charmian, Iras and
Enobarbus, all of whom of course know her intimately, will understand
that in flirting with Caesar's emissary she is simply reverting to a
reliable strategy, which has so often in the past enabled her to
manipulate situations to the best advantage. (She uses a similar
strategy later in the play when, with a misleading meekness, she
&quot;desires instruction&quot; from Caesar, &quot;that she preparedly may frame
herself to th' way she's forc'd to&quot; -5.1.54-56). Enobarbus, however, is
too intently focused on his own internal debates over deserting Antony
to make any such allowances: by taking Cleopatra's dalliance with
Thidias as a sign that his master's &quot;dearest&quot; friends are &quot;quit[ting]&quot;
he attempts to dilute the enormity of the perfidy which he himself is
contemplating, while at the same time, in typically ambivalent fashion,
satisfying his urge to serve Antony for a little while longer by
informing him of his mistress's apparent fickleness (3.13.62-65).
Antony's prompt acceptance of Cleopatra's protestations of loyalty
suggests that he is aware that he has overreacted, while Enobarbus'
failure even to mention the matter in his subsequent soliloquy provides
a strong hint that even he does not really credit his own suspicions
(3.13.105-31, 3.13.156-67, 3.13.194-200).</p>
<p>A character who was purely concerned with self-preservation would
undoubtedly have deserted her lover after his first defeat, as many of
Antony's followers do (3.12.3-6, 4.1.12-14, 4.6.15-16). However,
Cleopatra never colludes with the enemy in the way that Antony comes to
suspect, as is evident from the fact that Caesar has to send messengers
in order to discover her state of mind at the end of the play
(4.12.10-29, 5.1.67-68). Instead, she helps her lover on with his armour
before his next battle--her first visible act of care in the play--while
fantasising about him overcoming Caesar in single combat, and even
remains faithful when he has finally been decisively beaten (4.4.5-18,
4.4.36-38, 4.12.30-31). Moreover, as the play goes on, there is
increasing evidence that Cleopatra has finally accepted Charmian's
advice that the best way to elicit her lover's devotion is to attempt to
please him: not only does she apologise repeatedly after the battle of
Actium, as noted above, but she responds to Antony's accusations of
fickleness and promiscuity in the wake of the Thidias incident simply
with a great vow of loyalty, rather than the proud self-assertion which
one might have expected (3.11.54-68, 3.13.2, 3.13.105-67). After his
final defeat she initially attempts to placate her lover-- &quot;Why is my
lord enraged against his love?&quot;--and then, rather than reacting
indignantly to his spiteful prayer that she should be led in triumph
while being tormented by Octavia, merely exits in genuine confusion
(4.12.10-39, 4.13.1-3).</p>
<p>We can infer that it is by this time no longer Cleopatra's first impulse
to manipulate Antony from the fact that it is Charmian who has to
suggest that she adopt her habitual strategy of pretending to be dead in
order to soften her lover's anger (4.13.3-6). Although Cleopatra agrees
to this deception and even embellishes it with her own pathetic detail,
her subsequent &quot;prophesying fear&quot; that Antony might commit suicide out
of grief, which leads her to send messengers urgently to tell him the
truth, demonstrates not only her need for him, but also a new-found, if
partial, capacity to appreciate the passionate devotion which his
recriminations mask (4.14.120-27). Thus, during the second half of the
play, Cleopatra not only shows some courage and a degree of humble
restraint, but even a modicum of care and sympathetic understanding. She
is shrewd enough to recognise that she can only gain the intense
admiration that she craves if she is prepared to reciprocate her lover's
care. Overall, her behaviour in the second half of the play therefore
provides evidence that the most considered versions of self-love may
eventually generate a form of loyalty.</p>
<p>However, even the great oath of constancy which Cleopatra delivers after
the Thidias incident, in which she vows she is not &quot;cold-hearted&quot; toward
Antony, could actually be seen precisely as illustrating her coldness,
as well as her determination to remain loyal (3.13.158-62. The contrast
with Enobarbus underlines the fact that it is beyond the queen to feel
the desperate guilt which is the inevitable corollary of a failure to
provide the self-denying care that truly constant attachments entail:
whereas Cleopatra invites heaven to &quot;dissolve&quot; her instantly, it is
Enobarbus' own &quot;melancholy,&quot; personified by the moon, which punishes him
for his cold-heartedness, and moreover does so slowly and painfully, by
repeatedly &quot;throw[ing] [his] heart against the flint and hardness of
[his] fault&quot; in a manner that generates insistent &quot;foul thoughts&quot;
which he knows could only &quot;finish&quot; with his death (4.9.7-18). In
addition, the queen's oath is typically high-handed, in that she offers
both her subjects and her children as well as her own life as guarantees
of her loyalty. Moreover, it is not her own person--which is simply
&quot;dissolve[d]&quot;--but &quot;the memory of [her] womb, together with [her]
brave Egyptians all,&quot; whom she pictures, not exactly dying in &quot;some
ditch,&quot; like Enobarbus, but lying &quot;graveless,&quot; exposed to the &quot;flies and
gnats of Nile&quot; (3.13.159-67, 4.6.36-38). One may infer that she could
dispense with her subjects and even her children more easily than
Antony, because their adulation is likely to be less all-encompassing.
(Perhaps the most startling illustration of the queen's lack of care for
her children is her seeming indifference to Caesar's threat to put them
to &quot;destruction&quot; if she commits suicide to avoid being led in triumph
-5.2.131-33). Thus overall, her oath hints at her self-love rather than
demonstrating her devoted care in the manner that she intends.</p>
<p>Although the queen eventually learns to restrain her &quot;wrangling&quot; and
begins to demonstrate humble loyalty, her response to the loss, or
putative loss, of Antony exposes her underlying self-regard. When the
eponymous lovers both issue suits to Caesar after the defeat at Actium,
which they initially assume to be final, Antony simply &quot;requires to live
in Egypt,&quot; or, failing that, as &quot;a private man in Athens,&quot; presumably
with the hope of continuing his relationship with Cleopatra, whereas the
queen, who has already used her lover's power to ensure that her sons
are &quot;proclaim'd the kings of kings,&quot; &quot;craves the circle of the Ptolomies
for her heirs&quot; (3.12.11-14, 3.6.3-16). Again, we can see that Cleopatra
relishes her political status, albeit only as a secondary consideration
-she is no doubt astutely aware that Caesar would never allow Antony's
request.</p>
<p>Whereas Cleopatra ignores Antony's spiteful prediction that she will be
led in triumph while her priority is still to save the relationship, as
soon as she knows that her lover is dying, this concern gives way to her
fear of being displayed in &quot;th' imperious show of the full fortun'd
Caesar&quot;: it is this fear that prompts her to haul the dying Antony
laboriously up to join her on her monument, rather than venturing down
to kiss him (4.12.32-39, 4.14.18-40). Although after his death Cleopatra
figures herself as no different in her mourning from any humble &quot;maid
that milks and does the meanest chares,&quot; and apparently wishes to &quot;throw
[her] sceptre at the injurious gods,&quot; since &quot;all's but naught&quot; now
that they have &quot;stol'n our jewel,&quot; all the evidence is that her primary
concern is actually to preserve her dignity, and avoid being exhibited
to &quot;the shouting varletry of censuring Rome&quot; and &quot;mechanic slaves with
greasy aprons&quot; (4.15.73-91, 5.2.53-62, 5.2.208-13, 5.2.354-56). Indeed,
one may infer that even her most fervently grief-stricken eulogy of
Antony is in fact shrewdly calculated to manipulate Dolabella into
telling her whether Caesar &quot;will lead [her] then in triumph,&quot; since
she raises this issue with unceremonious abruptness as soon as she is
assured that he is feeling &quot;by the rebound&quot; a sympathetic &quot;grief that
smites [his] very heart at root&quot; (5.2.76-110). Far from dying for
love, like Eros and Enobarbus, because her intimacy with Antony is her
ruling passion, she commits suicide only when she has obtained proof
from Dolabella that her &quot;honor&quot; does &quot;not go together&quot; with her &quot;safety&quot;
(4.15.46-47).</p>
<p>Thus, in contrast to Eros and Enobarbus, whose deaths are both designed,
paradoxically, to preserve their sympathetic connection with their
master, Cleopatra ruthlessly prioritises her self-regard over her
loyalty to Antony at the end of the play. She is entirely consistent in
this, for a dead or dying Antony can no longer fulfil her craving to be
admired. The cool, self-regarding prudence which ultimately regulates
Cleopatra's behaviour is illustrated at the end of the play by her
refusal to trust Proculeius, despite being advised to do so by the
relatively naïve Antony; by her covert attempt to reserve some of her
wealth; and by the fact that she has &quot;pursu'd conclusions infinite of
easy ways to die&quot; (4.15.47-50, 5.2.13-15, 5.2.134-71, 5.2.355-56).
Cleopatra's concern for her dignity necessarily imposes its own
sacrifices, but she performs these in the most expedient manner
possible.</p>
<p>As a result of her underlying self-regard, however, Cleopatra ultimately
fails to gain from her lover the consistent admiration which she craves,
despite her best efforts. Antony's two great rages confirm that her
earlier attempts to &quot;enforce&quot; love have led him partly to &quot;hate&quot; what he
often &quot;fear[s],&quot; just as Charmian predicted, an animosity which was no
doubt compounded by her flight from the battle of Actium (1.3.6-12). The
disproportionate nature of these excoriations--there is only superficial
evidence for the first accusation of betrayal, as we have seen, and
apparently none at all for the second--suggests that they are
symptomatic of a pervasive, underlying distrust which Antony is unable
to repress in times of stress (3.13.105-31, 4.12.10-29). Cleopatra could
only hope to dispel his impression that she is a fickle &quot;boggler,&quot; who
plays &quot;fast and loose&quot; through a devoted sacrifice of Enobarbus-like
proportions (3.13.110, 4.12.28). Antony's tirades demonstrate that there
is no half way house in matters of the heart: only those who practise
unconditional, self-effacing devotion can generate it in others. The
paradoxical demands of the transactions which underpin deep attachments
far outstrip Cleopatra's crude and limited attempts to earn Antony's
devoted care. Her misfortune--tragedy is perhaps too strong a word--is
that she is just passionate enough to appreciate the depth of her
lover's devotion, but not sufficiently so to experience a need for a
truly intimate union, which would involve responding with her own
absolutely self-effacing service.</p>
<p>To sum up: Cleopatra adopts Antony as the primary source of the
adulation which she craves, because, unlike Caesar, she appreciates that
a lover's adoration can provide a much more intense and concentrated
form of gratification than public acclaim, although in fact neither are
intrinsic pleasures, but require a ceaseless measuring of her relative
distinction. At first, she uses tyrannical strategies in her effort to
maintain what she assumes to be a fleeting infatuation on Antony's part,
rooted in sexual desire and limited by self-regard. After the battle of
Actium, however, she is forced to recognise that these strategies are
actually detrimental to a devotion which is intrinsically generous and
self-denying, and finally starts to heed Charmian's warning that she
needs to reciprocate Antony's humble loyalty if she hopes to recover his
trust and so retain his sympathetic care. Cleopatra is loyal because she
understands that only a devoted lover such as Antony has proved himself
to be could supply her with the unremitting care and admiration which
she craves. In this way, Shakespeare shows that self-love in its most
ambitious and intelligent form may ultimately sublimate itself into
self-denial in a manner that mimics passionate devotion.</p>
<p>However, Antony's vicious attacks on Cleopatra suggest that characters
who are fundamentally self-regarding could never earn sufficient trust
to inspire an absolutely sympathetic devotion, even where they strive to
restrain their self-love. Such devotion is in fact the province of
characters like Eros and the dying Enobarbus, who prioritise their sense
of unity with their beloved even over the most instinctive demands of
the ego. Although Antony seems to forgive her repeatedly, it is beyond
Cleopatra's scope to regain the trust which she has forfeited by her
earlier &quot;wrangling[s]&quot; and her flight from the battle of Actium. Thus,
Shakespeare demonstrates that even the one-sided care that Cleopatra
craves, let alone the merging of interests which truly passionate lovers
pursue, may only be earnt by obeying the austere imperatives which deep
attachments inevitably impose.</p>
<p>Cleopatra's response to her lover's death confirms that his instinct not
to trust her fully was correct all along: as soon as the dying Antony
can no longer provide her with care, she retrenches, and focuses her
efforts on preserving the prestige which supplies her with a secondary
source of fuel for her self-regard. This pragmatic approach contrasts
with Eros' and Enobarbus' desperate grief and guilt respectively, since
it shows that her attachment is not in the end her ruling passion, even
if she had persuaded herself that it was. In reality, Cleopatra's story
is therefore much less tragic than that of Enobarbus, who, as we have
seen, manages to frustrate his own deepest needs, even though her
inability to pursue the ultimate good may be pitiable. It is from one
point of view comic that even as Antony is dying and trying to protect
his beloved from further harm, she interrupts him with a clichéd rant:
&quot;No, let me speak, and let me rail so high, that the false huswife
Fortune break her wheel&quot; (4.15.41-46). Although her self-love prevents
her from securing Antony's sympathetic care in the way that she was
hoping to do, this failure is the inevitable consequence of the fact
that, at the deepest level, her well-being never depended on doing so in
the first place. While the manner of Antony's death may resemble that of
Romeo in some respects, Cleopatra's suicide is therefore nothing like
that of Juliet, or even Thisbe.</p>
<h1>Antony</h1>
<p>Antony's decision to return to Rome shows that he has not in fact shed
his political ambitions, despite his fervent protestations to the
contrary (1.1.1-10, 1.1.18-55), but is as concerned to protect his
section of the empire as Caesar (1.2.99-117, 1.2.129-30, 1.2.183-96,
1.3.44-54). Once in Rome he seems to slot back easily into a world where
characters may &quot;borrow one another's love&quot; for a while, but only when it
is more advantageous to do so than to &quot;wrangle&quot; (2.2.103-06). His
ongoing concern to maintain his power and prestige is shown when he
insists that Caesar sits first at their meeting in an attempt to
demonstrate his control over the proceedings, and by his insistence that
his &quot;honesty shall not make poor [his] greatness,&quot; even as he
&quot;play[s] the penitent&quot; (2.2.28, 2.2.92-93). He not only marries
Octavia in order to cement his rapprochement with Caesar, but assures
her at first, apparently in all sincerity, that, despite his previous
&quot;blemishes,&quot; &quot;that to come shall all be done by th' rule,&quot; presumably
understanding that &quot;the band that seems to tie&quot; him to Caesar could
become &quot;the very strangler of their amity,&quot; if he were to be unfaithful
(2.2.124-52, 2.3.1-7, 2.7.120-22).</p>
<p>Antony's effort to &quot;break&quot; the &quot;fetters&quot; of this &quot;enchanting queen,&quot;
whom he sometimes wishes he &quot;had never seen,&quot; is driven not only by his
political ambition, but by his distrust of Cleopatra: he knows from the
start that she &quot;is cunning past man's thought,&quot; and implicitly agrees
with Enobarbus' sardonic hint that her passions are by no means composed
of &quot;the finest part of pure love&quot; (1.2.116, 1.2.128, 1.2.152, 1.2.42-43,
1.2.145-51). This is not, however, to question the sincerity of his
great vow analysed above, or to deny that his &quot;dotage&quot; has the potential
to &quot;o'erflow...the measure&quot; and &quot;renege...all temper&quot; (1.1.33-40,
1.1.1-10): he subsequently assures Cleopatra that his &quot;full heart
remains in use with [her]&quot; after his departure; that as her &quot;soldier,
servant,&quot; his &quot;purposes...are, or cease, as [she] shall give th'
advice&quot; (a point which he reiterates towards the end of the play
-4.12.26); that his love &quot;stands honorable trial;&quot; and that he will
&quot;remain with&quot; her in spirit during their separation (1.3.43-44,
1.3.66-71, 1.3.73-75, 1.3.102-04). On his way to Rome, he sends his
beloved pearls, &quot;doubled kisses&quot; and promises of &quot;kingdoms,&quot; all of
which he later fulfils (1.5.43-47, 3.6.3-16). All this supports
Enobarbus' view that he will &quot;never&quot; leave his beloved, however much it
is within his political interests to remain faithful to Octavia
(2.2.232-39). Antony's is a divided soul, however: although his devotion
to the queen ultimately runs deeper than either his concerns about her
character or his own political position, we shall see that these worries
are nevertheless substantial and recurring.</p>
<p>The process by which Antony rationalises his return to Egypt shows that,
although his determination to reunite with his beloved is overriding, he
cannot simply ignore his proud ambition. He consults a soothsayer who he
already knows &quot;wish[es] [him]self in Egypt,&quot; and who is cunning
enough to offer him a justification for returning to Cleopatra which
takes account of his pride, albeit in a paradoxical manner, since it
involves admitting Caesar's superiority (2.3.11-12). The soothsayer's
warning that his master should &quot;stay not by [Caesar's] side,&quot; since
his &quot;noble, courageous, high unmatchable&quot; soul is &quot;o'erpow'r'd&quot; and
&quot;afraid to govern him&quot; in his rival's presence, enables Antony to
interpret what is in reality simply a desire to resume his relationship
with Cleopatra as a determination to preserve his &quot;noble&quot; dignity, even
though the only evidence which he can adduce for this &quot;o'erpow'r[ing]&quot;
is the inferior performance of his cocks and quails (2.3.12-41). These
rationalisations allow him to substitute a lesser humiliation for the
greater indignity of his willing submission to &quot;strong Egyptian
fetters,&quot; and to reduce what is in fact an ardent attachment to a
sensual desire: &quot;i' th' East my pleasure lies&quot; (1.2.116, 2.3.39-41).
Thus, although his return to Egypt undoubtedly shows that his love runs
deeper than his pride in the end, he is at the same time too proud to
acknowledge his true priorities, even to himself. As we shall see,
Antony's attempt to pursue both his attachment to Cleopatra and his
political ambitions inevitably involves him in similar contradictions
and rationalisations throughout the play.</p>
<p>These contradictions are illustrated by Antony's relationships with his
followers. In contrast to Cleopatra, his passionate nature allows him to
moderate his pride sufficiently to engage directly with his servants: he
encourages his messengers to &quot;speak to me home, mince not the general
tongue,&quot; since &quot;who tells me true, though in his tale lie death, I hear
him as he flatter'd&quot; (1.2.88-112). As we have seen, Antony is generally
loved, not just by Eros and Enobarbus, but by all his &quot;good fellows,&quot;
because he is capable of demonstrating sympathetic care (4.2.10-36).
Nevertheless, the prudent Ventidius knows that, far from being rewarded
with &quot;triumphant chariots&quot; and &quot;garlands,&quot; he would actually lose the
&quot;favor&quot; which he has previously gained through his loyal service in
Parthia, if his military campaign were to win him higher &quot;fame&quot; and
&quot;renown&quot; than his master: he &quot;could do more to do Antonius good, but
'twould offend him&quot; (3.1.5-27). This apparently incidental reflection is
designed to explain why proud ambition exercises such a chilling effect
on attachments. As Enobarbus' rueful comment on the grudging nature of
his former praise for Pompey suggests, the mutual service and gratitude
on which lasting intimacies are based demands a radical humility
(2.7.75-78).</p>
<p>With the best will in the world it is of course impossible for a
political leader to establish an intimacy with all his subordinates:
Antony's wish that his men were &quot;clapp'd up together&quot; in a single
individual, so that he could do them &quot;service so good&quot; as they have
delivered, and that his palace had &quot;the capacity to camp this host,&quot; so
that they &quot;all would sup together,&quot; may remind us that he could never
reward his army in kind -though he does make a typically passionate
effort to thank them all personally for their sacrifices (4.2.10-19,
4.8.32-35). This imbalance of care suggests that his motive for courting
devotion on such a broad scale is likely to be self-regarding rather
than genuinely passionate: as Enobarbus implies, the speech which he
delivers to his &quot;sad captains&quot; is designed purely to allow him to savour
their sympathetic devotion (4.2.20-36, 3.13.183). On the other hand, his
decision to return Enobarbus' treasure--via the significantly named
Eros--shows that he is capable of offering his most intimate friends the
genuinely self-denying service upon which constant relationships are
founded: rather than thinking about his own needs or responding
indignantly, Antony pities his &quot;honest&quot; lieutenant for having been
&quot;corrupted&quot; by his master's &quot;fortunes,&quot; since he has had such great
&quot;cause to change a master&quot; (4.5.12-17). The contrast between Enobarbus'
stunned reaction to this generosity and his sardonic comment on his
master's speech to his captains highlights Antony's oscillations between
self-indulgent manipulation and passionate generosity, and at the same
time reminds the reader of the paradox that lovers fulfil their deepest
needs by providing, rather than demanding, care.</p>
<p>Shakespeare uses the battle of Actium and its aftermath to deepen his
exploration of Antony's divided soul. Antony's underlying priorities are
revealed as he effectively gives away &quot;the greater cantle of the world&quot;
in an effort to protect the fleeing Cleopatra (3.10.6-23). This episode
demonstrates in the clearest way possible that the humble service
required by passionate devotion is incompatible with ambition. At this
point Antony resembles Eros and the dying Enobarbus, since he
acknowledges for a moment that nothing matters more to him than his
attachment to his beloved. Subsequently, however, his pride reasserts
itself in characteristic fashion, and, &quot;blush[ing]&quot; to think of his
&quot;fear and doting,&quot; he rebukes his beloved because he must now &quot;send
humble treaties, dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness&quot;
(3.11.61-65). His fury over the Thidias affair has more to do with his
anger with Caesar for &quot;harping on what I am, not what he knew I was&quot; in
a &quot;proud and disdainful manner&quot; than with the queen's flirtation, which,
as we have seen, is a much more trivial affair than either he or
Enobarbus are initially prepared to allow (2.13.140-43). This proud rage
temporarily alienates him not only from his beloved, but from all human
ties, as is implied by his brutal invitation to Caesar to &quot;whip, or
hang, or torture&quot; one of his servants in return for his own whipping of
Thidias (3.13.147-51).</p>
<p>In this mood Antony sees Cleopatra entirely through the prism of his
self-regard, describing the hand which she has given Thidias to kiss,
not simply as the object of his affection, but as &quot;this kingly seal and
plighter of high hearts&quot; (3.13.125-26). Although Antony is primarily
pursuing the simple satisfaction of a constant intimacy in his romance,
he has always relished his own and the queen's status as celebrities as
a subordinate incentive: even in the opening scene when he is declaring
his indifference to ambition, he dignifies his love as &quot;nobleness&quot; and
calls upon &quot;the world to weet we stand up peerless,&quot; when &quot;such a mutual
pair and such a twain&quot; embrace (1.1.36-40). Similarly, he soothes his
anguish over Cleopatra's supposed death by conjuring up a gratifying
vision of &quot;the ghosts gaz[ing]&quot; at the lovers' &quot;sprightly port&quot; in the
afterlife: &quot;Dido and Aeneas shall want troops, and all the haunt be
ours&quot; (4.14.44-54).</p>
<p>Subsequently, Antony's attitude to Cleopatra varies for a while
according to whether his pride is gratified or abashed by his
oscillating military fortunes: he first praises &quot;this great fairy&quot;
extravagantly after winning a temporary victory, which clearly satisfies
his desire both to demonstrate his undiminished vigour and to win public
&quot;applaus[e],&quot; and then relieves the humiliation of his final defeat--
&quot;the hearts that spanell'd [him] at heels&quot; now &quot;discandy, melt their
sweets on blossoming Caesar&quot;--by castigating the queen, although there
is absolutely no evidence that she has betrayed him (4.8.1-39,
4.12.20-24). Thus, the eponymous lovers' attachment is blighted by
self-love on both sides: Antony's anger with Cleopatra, which drives her
to feign death with all the disastrous consequences that follow, is
certainly rooted in the distrust which her former manipulations have
engendered, just in the way that Charmian predicted, but the immediate
trigger is his own thwarted ambition (1.3.11-12).</p>
<p>Before being informed of Cleopatra's death, Antony's reasons for
contemplating suicide--he does no more than this--are primarily
self-regarding. He feels &quot;dislimn[ed], and...indistinct&quot; when stripped
of his proud ambition (4.14.1-14):</p>
<p>I made these wars for Egypt, and the Queen,</p>
<p>Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine--</p>
<p>Which whilst it was mine had annex'd to unto't</p>
<p>A million moe (now lost)--she, Eros, has</p>
<p>Pack'd cards with Caesar's, and false-played my glory</p>
<p>Unto an enemy's triumph.</p>
<p>(4.14.15-20)</p>
<p>Far from making &quot;these wars for Egypt,&quot; as he claims, Antony has
savoured the &quot;glory&quot; which he has derived from &quot;annex[ing]&quot; a
&quot;million&quot; hearts, and is now relieving his bitterness at the loss of his
status by tormenting the queen. However, Cleopatra's apparent death
immediately recalls Antony to his deepest needs: he abruptly breaks off
from his self-pitying recriminations, and for a moment it seems that his
heart will &quot;crack&quot; with grief and guilt in the same way as Enobarbus'
(4.14.38-41). It is significant that his one soliloquy in this scene
makes no references to his military defeats, but is entirely focused on
the prospect of overtaking Cleopatra in the afterlife and &quot;weep[ing]
for [his] pardon&quot; (4.14.44-54). He does not now think of blaming her
even when he discovers her deceit, but simply requests a kiss
(4.14.127-132, 4.15.18-21). As he is dying, Antony shows a humble
concern that she should take refuge with Caesar, thus valuing his
beloved's &quot;safety&quot; both over her &quot;honour&quot; and his own proud rancour
against his rival (4.14.15-50). In sum, Antony is eventually forced to
recognise that he cannot truly be &quot;dislimn[ed]&quot; even by the most
abject humiliation, but only by the loss of his beloved.</p>
<p>However, although Antony certainly aligns himself more closely with his
deeper needs in response to the apparent loss of his queen, he is still
distracted by self-regard. Unlike Enobarbus, Antony not only imagines
himself continuing to pursue public acclaim in the afterlife, even in
his anguished soliloquy, but is willing to &quot;weep for [his] pardon&quot;
without any attempt to atone for his failure to deliver the self-denying
care on which a truly trusting intimacy must be based (4.14.44-54).
Moreover, when Eros returns, Antony takes care to preserve his dignity
by presenting himself as committing suicide for noble reasons, as in the
high Roman tradition: his death will allow him to avoid &quot;baseness&quot; and
&quot;dishonor&quot; and enable him to &quot;defeat...&quot; Caesar, since it ensures that
he avoids the &quot;shame&quot; of being led in triumph (4.14.55-77).</p>
<p>The manner of Antony's death suggests that his self-regard is too
engrained to allow him to destroy himself instantly like Eros, purely as
a passionate response to his grief: far from relying only on &quot;thought
[to] do't,&quot; like Enobarbus, whose passion is perhaps of an even
greater order of intensity than Eros', he first attempts to delegate the
task to his trusted lieutenant and then botches it when he is forced to
undertake it himself (4.14.55-62, 4.14.95-101, 4.6.33-35). Although
there is no doubt that Antony is primarily bent on receiving one last
kiss as he is dying, he nevertheless introduces himself dramatically to
Cleopatras and her attendants in the monument as a man whose
&quot;valor...has triumph'd on itself,&quot; rather than allowing itself to be
&quot;o'erthrown&quot; by Caesar, and reminds them that he has &quot;liv'd the greatest
prince o' th' world, the noblest&quot; (4.15.14-21, 4.15.51-57). By contrast,
Cleopatra reverses these priorities, as is indicated by her decision to
haul her lover up to her monument rather than run any risk of being
humiliated by Caesar (4.15.21-37). Whereas Enobarbus, Eros and Antony
all end their lives painfully, albeit perhaps with varying degrees of
stern resolve, Cleopatra's suicide is both the easiest and the most
hesitant of the four: &quot;she hath pursued conclusions infinite of easy
ways to die&quot; (5.2.355-56). Thus, the four deaths which are portrayed in
the play illustrate the erotic hierarchy which Shakespeare implicitly
outlines. Whereas, with the exception of Eros, the capacity of all the
characters to form devoted attachments is to a greater or lesser extent
diminished by their self-regard, Cleopatra's is degraded beyond
recognition.</p>
<p>The characters' various reactions to loss also reflect their position in
this hierarchy. At the apex are Eros and the dying Enobarbus, who cannot
live without Antony and are in the end completely indifferent to the
world's &quot;register&quot;: Eros not only dies quickly and unobtrusively
himself, but clearly remains unmoved by Antony's argument that he could
help him avoid the &quot;baseness&quot; of a triumph; just as Antony himself
cannot in the end bear the thought of his beloved dying, even if it is
to avoid such a humiliation (4.9.19-22, 4.14.67-77, 4.15.45-47). By
contrast, the ambivalent Antony &quot;desire[d]&quot; Fulvia's death because her
political and military ambitions had so frequently conflicted with his
own-- &quot;what our contempts doth often hurl from us, we wish it ours
again&quot;--but is as shocked as Enobarbus when it actually occurs
(1.2.122-27, 2.2.156-60; see also 2.2.61-71), and moreover, wept at
finding &quot;Brutus slain,&quot; even though the two men had been deadly enemies
on the battle-field (3.2.55-56). These examples show that Antony is able
to detach himself from his shallower attachments until he has secured
his strategic aims. Thus, he does no more than &quot;threat...the throat of
that his officer that murd'red Pompey&quot; so conveniently, even though he
has counted the latter as his friend (3.5.18-19) -just as Pompey himself
admits frankly that he would have found Menas' murderous plot
&quot;afterwards well done,&quot; if &quot;done unknown,&quot; even though he now feels
obliged to &quot;condemn&quot; it, partly no doubt because Antony and he &quot;are
friends&quot; (2.7.73-80, 2.7.126-29; see above). However, Antony's pursuit
of Cleopatra at Actium and his magnanimous response to Enobarbus'
desertion show that he has always aligned himself with those he truly
loves in extremis. In the end, as we have seen, he comes to resemble the
dying Enobarbus more than he differs from him, since he finally sheds
his pride sufficiently to attempt to enshrine his devotion as his ruling
passion: as we have seen, not only does he refrain from blaming his
beloved for his death, but he implores her in the most abject fashion to
avoid thoughts of suicide and instead seek the protection of his hated
rival (4.15.45-47).</p>
<p>By contrast with the ambivalent Antony and Pompey, who are restrained by
their attachments from pursuing their ambitions whole-heartedly, the
apparently single-minded Caesar has Lepidus killed without compunction,
although even he weeps at the departure of Octavia, despite the fact
that he himself engineered it (3.1.50-5). Although Caesar responds
coolly to Antony's death, breaking off smoothly from an elaborate lament
when he is interrupted by important &quot;business&quot; related to his current
project of leading Cleopatra in triumph (5.1.13-51), there is a hint
that the demise of his rival has actually led him to contemplate the
ephemerality of his own power, in however fleeting a manner: &quot;When such
a spacious mirror's set before him, he needs must see himself&quot;
(5.1.34-35). Thus, loss and bereavement not only remind most of the
characters forcefully of their underlying attachments, but expose the
ultimate futility of their ambition. Cleopatra is the great exception
here, since, if the above argument is correct, her response to Antony's
death confirms that she is entirely &quot;cold in blood&quot; (1.5.74).</p>
<p>Thus, the relationship between the eponymous lovers is based on fragile
foundations on both sides, since they are each too proud to offer their
respective beloveds the consistently self-denying, sympathetic service
which is required to build up a robust fund of mutual trust and
gratitude.</p>
