            <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The conversation between Kent and Gloucester which opens the play
indicates that the division of the kingdom was not in fact designed to
be dependent upon the love test, as might at first appear both to
inattentive members of the audience and much of the assembled company,
but has been carefully planned in advance, possibly with the help of
Lear's chief counsellors, and certainly with their approval (1.1.1-7).
Although Lear has rejected Cordelia by the time that he fully reveals
his scheme to secure his succession, we can infer from the speech in
which he formally transfers his power to Goneril and Regan that his
original plan was to &quot;invest&quot; his &quot;pre-eminence&quot; in his youngest
daughter, as well as giving her &quot;a third more opulent&quot; than her sisters,
and thus to surrender to Burgundy, who was clearly designed to be her
husband, the regal &quot;sway, revenue, execution&quot; which he ultimately
presents to Albany and Cornwall, while retaining for himself only &quot;the
name, and all th' addition to a king&quot; (1.1.79-82, 1.1.127-39,
1.1.189-91). <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> It is significant that neither Gloucester nor the
forthright Kent expresses any objection to this original scheme in their
opening conversation.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> When Kent does eventually intervene, it is not
to reprimand Lear for surrendering his power, but specifically for
transferring it to Goneril and Regan (1.1.151-54).</p>
<p>Kent and Gloucester are surprised by only one aspect of the planned
division: they had &quot;thought the king had more affected the Duke of
Albany than Cornwall,&quot; but &quot;now in the division of the kingdom, it
appears not which of the Dukes he values most&quot; (1.1.1-7). Under the
original plan--which must have been long in the making, since it
presumably predates their marriages--Goneril and Regan would have been
deterred from attacking each other precisely by this &quot;equality,&quot; and
from uniting to oppose their sister by the fact that Cordelia's &quot;more
opulent&quot; territory would have divided Albany in the north from Cornwall
in the south of the kingdom. Given that the aged Lear lacks a male heir,
and clearly wishes to circumvent any conventional expectations that
Goneril might inherit his sovereign power as his eldest daughter, he
clearly needs a plan of succession in order to ensure the future
stability of the kingdom. This scheme was therefore much more prudent
than might at first appear, since, as subsequent events demonstrate, it
is based on an accurate understanding both of Cordelia's superior virtue
and of her sisters' potentially disruptive ambition. Indeed, we may
infer from the conversation between Kent and Gloucester which opens the
play that Lear has even understood that Cornwall will be a less just
ruler than Albany, but decides in the end that it would be imprudent to
act on this understanding, presumably because he sees that to assign
more land to the latter, and hence to Goneril, might disrupt the
delicate balance of power, whereby he hopes &quot;that future strife may be
prevented now&quot; (1.1.43-45).</p>
<p>Overall, despite its ultimate failure, for which, I will argue, the king
himself is only partly responsible, the plan could actually be seen as
the final expression of the vigilant prudence which has enabled Lear to
become &quot;the greatest of Shakespeare's kings,&quot; as we meet him at the
start of the play, standing &quot;at the head of a united Britain...and at
peace, not only with all domestic factions, but with the outside world
as well.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> It is important to note that the rage which overcomes Lear
when Cordelia refuses to cooperate with the scheme is treated as a &quot;mad&quot;
aberration by Kent, who has previously seen no reason not to &quot;honor...&quot;
and &quot;lov[e]&quot; him (1.1.139-46). The prudence and warm-heartedness which
have previously characterised Lear's reign are reflected not only in his
preference for Albany over Cornwall and for Cordelia over her sisters,
but in his choice of Gloucester and Kent as his chief advisors, both of
whom show enormous loyalty later on in the play.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>The &quot;darker purpose&quot; of the love test (1.1.36) is to justify and gain
public consent for the prearranged, unequal division of the kingdom, in
which the youngest daughter is, unconventionally, to be given the
controlling share, while using the ambition of Goneril and Reagan to
trick them into complying with the scheme with an appearance of devoted
obedience.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Lear keeps his plan for the love test entirely secret,
even perhaps from Kent and Gloucester, probably in order to ensure that
the two elder sisters are caught off guard. For all Goneril and Reagan
know, as they consider the matter in the heat of the moment, they could
indeed earn a larger share of the kingdom by excelling in the love test.
It is only Cordelia who is in a position to understand that this is not
actually the case, since the rest of the territory has already been
allocated when it comes to her turn.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> Perhaps Lear hopes to ensure
her compliance by making it clear at this point that the love test is
irrelevant, since he has already decided that she should be his
successor. Regan is better placed than Goneril to have discovered the
scheme if given the time to do so, but Lear hurries through the
exercise, no doubt precisely in order to conceal its inconsistencies.</p>
<p>We may infer from the above that just rule tends to involve the cunning
manipulation of common opinion. Lear's decision to present what is in
fact a premeditated choice as a spontaneous effort to choose between
different degrees of passionate devotion reflects his shrewd
understanding that political authority is invariably strengthened if it
is perceived to be rooted in nature rather than arbitrarily imposed.
Because the populace as a whole cannot be expected to value Cordelia's
professions of &quot;care and duty,&quot; which are indeed commensurate with her
passionate &quot;love,&quot; just as she claims, over her sisters' superficial
obsequiousness, they have to be manipulated into sharing Lear's natural
esteem for his youngest daughter (1.1.100-02).</p>
<p>Thus, ironically, Lear can only secure the position of Cordelia, whom he
loves with an entirely spontaneous affection, and whose own loving
nature makes her his natural successor, through a cunning artifice which
temporarily debases that love. Shakespeare foregrounds the tension
between natural feeling and the demands of politics as a key theme in
the play's opening lines: Lear's reluctant decision to scale down the
territory which is to be offered to Albany, despite his personal
affection for the duke and even his percipient understanding that he
would rule more justly than Cornwall, demonstrates, in the words of a
perceptive critic, that &quot;the uncompromising quest for truth and love,
which can be ultimately understood as different names for the same
thing, destroy[s] justice...that is, serving the common good.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>
Having made this decision, Lear even schools himself to give Cornwall
primacy when he addresses his two son in laws: &quot;Our son of Cornwall, and
you, our no less loving son of Albany&quot; (1.1.41-42).</p>
<p>Another example of the dissimulation which politics inevitably involves
is the need for those in authority to project an illusion of
infallibility, or at least robust and consistent decisiveness. Lear
points to the accommodations which are required in order to ensure that
his &quot;potency&quot; is always &quot;made good&quot; when he warns the exasperated Kent
that he &quot;durst never yet&quot; &quot;break [his] vow,&quot; since &quot;nor our nature nor
our place can bear&quot; contradiction (1.1.168-72). His reference to
&quot;nature&quot; as well as &quot;place&quot; shows that he recognises the need to present
himself as innately assertive and determined, but the word &quot;durst&quot; hints
at the constraints which this necessity imposes, and indeed might be
seen as an early expression of regret regarding his abrupt change of
plan. Whereas Lear is clearly willing to expose his vacillations over
the share of land to be allotted to Cornwall and Albany to his closest
advisors, his public presentation of this matter is absolutely decisive
(compare 1.1.1-7 with 1.1.63-82). Thus, Shakespeare suggests that
political authority naturally demands the fabrication of a persona which
is stronger and wiser than most real individuals could ever hope to be.</p>
<p>Lear's initial concern is not that Cordelia does not love him, but that
she responds to the love test in a manner so utterly shorn of sentiment
as to make it very difficult to pretend that her vow is more passionate
than those of Goneril and Regan: &quot;Nothing will come of nothing, speak
again&quot; (1.1.86-90). Just a &quot;little&quot; adjustment on her part would no
doubt have allowed Lear to declare that he preferred her heartfelt and
understated style to the fulsome eloquence of her sisters, as was no
doubt his plan: &quot;Mend your speech a little, lest you may mar your
fortunes&quot; (1.1.94-95). The king has presumably decided not to inform
Cordelia of his plans precisely for fear that she might dislike the
artificiality of the test, or possibly even reveal his &quot;darker purpose,&quot;
but when planning to present her with this <em>fait accompli</em> he could have
had no idea that she would register her disapproval by actively
minimising the heartfelt affection which he knows that she actually
feels (1.1.91-104). Her profession of cool dutifulness is hardly more
helpful in political terms than her initial determination to say
&quot;nothing,&quot; since &quot;bond[s]&quot; of duty are bound to be weakened wherever
they are presented as purely conventional, with little or no admixture
of natural affection (1.1.92-93, 1.1.96-98).</p>
<p>Arguably, indeed, Lear's furious insistence that Cordelia's &quot;plainness&quot;
is a form of &quot;pride&quot; is partly justified, for it is surely her dignified
sense of her own virtue and fastidious distaste for anything that seems
contrived, as well as her passionate nature, which prevent her from
saying enough to facilitate Lear's plan to justify his preference for
her (1.1.129).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> The pride which Cordelia takes in her code of honour
is evident in her subsequent anxiety to ensure that France and Burgundy
should know that she is being rejected for lacking &quot;the glib and oily
art to speak and purpose not,&quot; rather than for any &quot;dishonored step&quot;
(1.1.223-233). Thus, the presentation of Cordelia introduces the idea
that codes of nobility and honour are forms of sublimated self-love.
Such codes generally reinforce passionate attachments and therefore
social cohesion, but they may also cause the noble and passionate to
bridle at the accommodations and hypocrisies which involvement in
politics inevitably demands.</p>
<p>Moreover, given Lear's own passion and nobility, evident in his
preference for forthright characters like Kent, the fool and Cordelia
herself, he too must find the contrived professions of love which the
test is designed to elicit deeply uncongenial. His vacillation over the
issue of whether to give Albany a greater territory than Cornwall shows
that he too experiences a natural urge to prioritise his sincere
thoughts and feelings over political considerations. It is likely,
therefore, that Lear envies Cordelia's freedom to express her feelings
directly and to adhere straightforwardly to her habitual code of
nobility, since it contrasts so sharply with the constraints which have
been imposed on him by his own concern to secure the stability of the
kingdom.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> The savagery of his anger may therefore be seen as a
measure of the stress which his political role normally entails.
Anticipating that both Burgundy and France would reject Cordelia after
he has cut her off, Lear perhaps even takes a spiteful delight in
showing her what life is like with &quot;truth&quot; as her only &quot;dow'r,&quot; when she
is no longer &quot;neighbor'd, pitied, and relieved&quot; by his authority
(1.1.108-20). Lear's message to Cordelia--which must be subconscious,
since events show that he himself has not fully grasped the point--is
that her noble code and the sincere relationships which she so treasures
are much more reliant than she realises on the security provided by this
authority, and on the benevolent manipulations by which he regulates
potentially disruptive ambitions.</p>
<p>Lear's nature is fundamentally passionate, as we may infer from the
close relationship which he shares with Cordelia, not to mention with
Kent and the fool (1.1.139-42). Indeed, the main purpose of his
intricate plan is perhaps to secure his own future with Cordelia, and at
the same time to protect and reward a daughter who is his &quot;joy,&quot; the
&quot;balm of [his] age, the best, the dearest&quot;: &quot;I lov'd her most, and
thought to set my rest on her kind nursery&quot; (1.1.82, 1.1.214-16,
1.1.123-24). Lear's desire to retire to Cordelia's &quot;nursery&quot; shows that
he ultimately values his intimate attachments above his political
concerns. Clearly, although politics may not in reality entirely lack
intrinsic rewards (see below), it has impelled the king to engage in all
sorts of artifices, which conflict with the sincerity that is an
integral element of deep attachments, while seemingly being requited
only by the insubstantial gratifications of &quot;pomp&quot; (3.4.33). At the same
time, however, driven no doubt both by conventional piety and nobility
as well as natural patriotism, Lear clearly feels too much
responsibility for his kingdom simply to abdicate.</p>
<p>As he himself admits, Lear is thus furious with Cordelia above all for
thwarting his attempt to find a means of prioritising his attachment to
her which does not conflict with his patriotism and code of nobility
(1.1.122-24). As the scene goes on, he begins to believe, perhaps, as
noted, not entirely without justice, that she is indeed &quot;untender&quot; in
her own &quot;heart,&quot; not because he doubts the strength of her attachment,
but precisely because, unlike the king himself, she values her sense of
her own passionate sincerity too much to make the contrived professions
of love which would safeguard the kingdom, and consequently enable both
of them to focus on the &quot;joy&quot; of their relationship (1.1.105-06,
1.1.38-41, 1.1.82).</p>
<p>The paradox which infuriates Lear so much, and which the opening scene
is designed to expose, is that while constant attachments may only
flourish where there is civic stability, the just rulers who are
responsible for preserving that stability are themselves often unable to
enjoy the relationships which they are likely to value above all else
because of all the hypocrisies and accommodations which their role
inevitably entails. It is significant that whereas Goneril and Regan
strain to gain power and status, Cordelia, who, as her name implies, is
primarily ruled by heartfelt attachments, remains completely unmoved by
the prospect that she might &quot;mar [her] fortunes&quot; through her plain
speech (1.1.94-95). Lear and Cordelia both understand that many of the
rewards which political life offers are insubstantial compared to those
that are provided by personal intimacy. Just as Lear's primary aim is
arguably to secure his own future with Cordelia, so Cordelia herself is
much more concerned with her future husband, to whom she will give &quot;half
[her] love...care and duty,&quot; than with the political situation
(1.1.101-02).</p>
<p>Overall, therefore, the opening scene indicates firstly that noble lies
are necessary in politics, and secondly that this necessity is bound to
frustrate the majority of just rulers, whose concern for justice is both
an expression of their instilled code of virtue and of their natural
proclivity for trusting attachments.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> During the play Shakespeare
expands on the uses and limitations of conventional beliefs in civic
life, along with the ways in which they interact with natural
attachments; the nature of the self-love which they are designed to
control; the strengths and weaknesses of particular conventional codes;
the dangers of enlightenment; <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> and, perhaps most importantly of
all, the issue of whether anyone is innately suited to the role of just
ruler, given the inherently unnatural character of political life.</p>
<h1>The Nature of Self-Love</h1>
<p>Ironically, the chaos precipitated by Lear's sudden <em>volte-face</em>
accidentally functions as a genuine love test, which exposes the nature
of various groups of characters who might have been indistinguishable in
the old regime. At the end of the opening scene, we are given an ominous
glimpse of the overriding nature of Goneril's ambition. As soon as Lear
has surrendered his sovereignty, Goneril begins her campaign to
marginalise him on the grounds of senility: &quot;If our father carry
authority with such disposition as he bears, this last surrender of his
will but offend us&quot; (1.1.304-06). It is important to note that the two
elder sisters are so automatically self-loving that they could not be
said to make a decision to prioritise their ambitions over filial
affection or codes of duty. Goneril and Regan operate outside the arena
of moral choice and responsibility, since they lack the natural ties
from which moral codes are ultimately derived.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> Lear's actual,
unintentional love test reveals that Goneril neither loves Lear nor
reveres his &quot;authorities,&quot; which in her view were simply &quot;given away&quot;
when he surrendered his power to enforce them (1.3.16-18). Whereas the
just characters normally see obedience to such &quot;authorities&quot; both as a
moral duty and as a matter of passionate patriotism, as Kent's continued
allegiance to Lear's lapsed &quot;authority&quot; indicates (1.4.23-30), Goneril
is now shown to have been restrained only by her fear of the military
force by which the king's rule was ultimately underwritten: thus, her
overriding priority in the first part of the play is to dismantle Lear's
retinue of a hundred knights (1.4.238-252, 1.4.322-27). Goneril and
Regan represent an extreme of ambition, abstracted from the moderating
influence of attachments (as far as it is possible to do so) and
conventional codes in a manner calculated to expose the essential nature
of self-love.</p>
<p>The fool implies that there is no point in remonstrating with Goneril
and Regan, because their self-love is by no means &quot;monst[rous]&quot; or
&quot;disnatur'd,&quot; as Lear assumes, but rather an integral element of the
human psyche, which may easily become a ruling principle (1.5.40,
1.4.281-83). In the fool's view, his master has simply &quot;fed the cuckoo
for so long, that it had it head bit off by it young,&quot; as would be
entirely in accord with the bird's instinct, were its foster parents
ever to become vulnerable to its predation (1.4.214-16). Far from
arguing with Lear's conviction that he was &quot;so kind a father&quot;--as the
outspoken fool would certainly be perfectly capable of doing--he rebukes
the king only for his naivety in expecting any more from Goneril than
callous ingratitude (1.5.8-45). Goneril's observation that Lear &quot;always
lov'd our sister most&quot; cannot be taken as evidence of an emotional abuse
in any way proportionate to the callousness of her subsequent actions;
indeed, the purpose of her remark is not to analyse her relationship
with her father, or even apparently to express resentment, but, with
typical practicality, to use his abrupt rejection of Cordelia to justify
her plan to side-line him on the grounds that he is losing his judgement
(1.1.290-92). There is no sign in the play that the elder sisters have
been mistreated or starved of affection, as is clearly the case with
Edmund, or even that they resent their favoured sibling in the same way
that Edmund clearly resents Edgar. Indeed, it is possible that Lear's
preference for Cordelia is, wholly or in part, an effect rather than a
cause of his elder daughters' unremitting focus on their own ambitions.</p>
<p>Being an irreducible element of the psyche, self-love is not in itself
amenable to analysis, although we may perhaps infer from the example of
the cuckoo that it is rooted in the survival instinct. The processes
which lead some souls to enshrine it as a ruling principle are often as
shrouded in mystery as the origins of the Pleiades: the fool observes
that no-one can determine why &quot;the seven stars are no moe than seven,&quot;
leaving his master to recall both that the constellation was also known
as the Seven Sisters and that it was traditionally associated with grief
(1.5.34-38). The fool's metaphor hints that he is no believer in
astrology, which, as we shall see, the play generally employs as a
veiled analogy for religion: he has no explanation, either natural or
supernatural, for &quot;how an oyster makes his shell,&quot; but, he seems to
suggest, simply accepts that pearls form in some souls and not in others
for reasons which are so intricate as to be literally imponderable
(1.5.25-26).</p>
<p>Although conventional codes of morality and religion may effectively
promote social cohesion and ostracise self-love (see below), in lawless
times egregiously ambitious characters often have the advantage over
their just counterparts, precisely because they are unencumbered by
sympathetic ties or conventional principles. As Edmund shows when he
condemns his brother's lack of reverence for fathers and gods, and as
Goneril demonstrates when she justifies her desire to reduce Lear's
train of knights by accusing them of &quot;insolent&quot; and &quot;shame[ful]&quot;
disrespect, these characters are perfectly capable of exploiting codes
of piety and honour in order to further their ambitions (2.1.38-50,
1.4.201-14). The civil order therefore needs the protection of rulers
like Lear, as he initially presents himself, and Edgar (see below), who
are able to match the self-lovers' unscrupulous willingness and cunning
capacity to manipulate attachments and social convention. Although Lear
differs radically from Edmund in the way that he defines human nature,
he nevertheless resembles him in the opening scene in prioritising
natural right over the arbitrary rules which govern succession: just as
Lear understands that it is precisely the daughter best fitted to
succeed him who is least likely to do so according to the convention of
primogeniture, so Edmund knows that it is merely &quot;custom&quot; which
&quot;deprive[s]&quot; him of power and status, since he is &quot;as well compact,
[his] mind as generous&quot; as Edgar, despite being a bastard, as well as
&quot;twelve or fourteen moonshines lag of a brother&quot; (1.2.2-9). Using
primogeniture as an example, Shakespeare suggests that established
customs reinforce stability, but at the expense of imposing arbitrary
rules which a just ruler must at times be prepared to manipulate.</p>
<p>It is clear from a fairly early point that, once the king has abandoned
his original plan of succession, the ambitious characters were
eventually bound to come into conflict in precisely the manner which
Lear's original plan was designed to forestall (3.1.19-26, 3.3.8-9).
Overall, the play implicitly endorses Albany's warning that self-love
ultimately threatens the civic order itself: &quot;Humanity must perforce
prey on itself, like monsters of the deep&quot; (4.2.49-50). Goneril shows
how events might have proceeded at the end of the play, when she
squabbles in public with Regan, whom she has just poisoned, over which
one of them should &quot;enjoy&quot; Edmund, while reminding her husband, whom she
has just been shown to have planned to murder, that she cannot be
&quot;arraign[ed],&quot; since &quot;the laws are mine, not thine&quot; (5.3.66-81,
4.6.262-70, 5.3.159-60). Events prove that Lear's authority, sustained
as it was by a number of salutary conventions, and ultimately by
military force, was always a relatively fragile edifice, which concealed
the true nature of the threat posed by self-love even as it successfully
kept it at bay (see below).</p>
<p>By contrast with Goneril and Regan, Edmund's single-minded focus on his
own ambitions is clearly provoked by the stigma of illegitimacy. His
opening speeches introduce the idea that 'enlightened' philosophy may be
both highly disruptive and deeply misleading: he enshrines &quot;Nature,&quot; by
which he means self-love, as his &quot;goddess,&quot; and believes that sons would
naturally supplant &quot;aged tyranny, who sways, not as it hath power, but
as it is suffer'd,&quot; were they not duped into obedience by &quot;the plague of
custom&quot; (1.2.1-4, 1.2.49-51). Edmund's claim to be pursuing innate
ambition absolutely freely-- &quot;I should have been that I am, had the
maidenl'est star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing&quot;
(1.2.131-33)--is undermined by the obsessive intensity of his rage at
the unfairness of established convention: &quot;Why bastard? Wherefore base?
When my dimensions are as well compact...as honest madam's issue&quot;
(1.2.6-9). His treatment has indeed been radically inequitable:
Gloucester has not only ensured that he &quot;hath been out nine years,&quot; but
already determined that &quot;away he shall again,&quot; in order to conceal a
&quot;fault&quot; which the duke &quot;blush[es] to acknowledge&quot; (1.1.290,
1.1.10-33). The duke has denied his illegitimate son access to the court
so consistently that even Kent, who seems to have been Lear's closest
companion for many years, has to be introduced to him at the start of
the play (1.1.139-42, 1.1.8-31). Thus, Shakespeare intimates that the
philosophical intuitions of 'free thinkers' who, following Machiavelli,
elevate self-love into a ruling principle may have simply been distorted
by environments which thwart their natural urge to form attachments.</p>
<p>Edmund has perhaps been warped even more radically by emotional neglect
than by his relatively low social status: he attempts earnestly but
unavailingly to gain Gloucester's sympathy for a self-inflicted wound,
and appears to take a bitter relish in representing Edgar as having
denied that he could ever carry sufficient &quot;trust, virtue, or worth&quot; for
his father to believe his putative accusations (2.1.41, 2.1.67-77).
Thus, although the play broadly supports the conventional codes which
reinforce the established order, Shakespeare uses Edmund to show that
they can also cause severe collateral damage on occasion. (Later in the
play, Kent and Gloucester's snobbish distaste for poor Tom provides a
further illustration of this point: 5.3.209-13, 3.4.142). In this case,
the support that these codes provide for the natural desire for lasting,
monogamous relationships inevitably comes at the price of ostracising
illegitimate offspring. The similarity between Edmund and Edgar's names
suggests that they share a common nature beneath the artificially
imposed differences, and therefore that, under different circumstances,
Edmund could have been as just as Edgar.</p>
<p>Ironically, &quot;[un]bordered&quot; self-love is ultimately shown to be
self-destructive, since attachment is a basic human need, which cannot
simply be ignored: &quot;that nature which...will sliver and disbranch from
her material sap, perforce must wither, and come to deadly use&quot;
(4.2.32-36). If Goneril and Regan were completely focused on gaining
power, they would not have succumbed in such a humiliating fashion to
Edmund's charms, thus enabling him to manipulate them at will
(5.1.55-65). Regan is desperate to wean her &quot;sweet lord&quot; away from her
sister, while for her part, Goneril would &quot;rather lose the battle than
that sister should loosen him and me,&quot; a possibility which &quot;exasperates,
makes [her] mad&quot; (5.1.1-19). Although self-love and physical desire
both undoubtedly play a part in this rivalry (4.2.26-28, 4.6.265-69,
5.1.10-13), there is no doubt that Goneril's love at least goes beyond
pride or lust, as Edmund comes to understand: &quot;Yet Edmund was belov'd!
The one the other poison'd for my sake, and after slew herself&quot;
(5.3.240-42). Goneril appears at first to represent the very abstract
embodiment of thrusting ambition, but even she is utterly humbled, and
ultimately destroyed by her passionate attachments.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Goneril is capable of forming sympathetic ties.
Shakespeare implies that her attachments mingle with her desire for
power, and of course her lust, in a manner that would ultimately have
been self-destructive even if Edmund had survived the duel, since she is
attracted to the very quality of spirited ambition which renders her
lover untrustworthy, and, by the same token, repelled by the very
sympathetic moderation which is the hallmark of lasting attachments: &quot;O,
the difference of man and man! To thee a woman's services are due, a
fool usurps my bed&quot; (4.2.26-28). Thus, although self-love is undoubtedly
natural, it lacks substantial, intrinsic rewards. Those who follow
traditional moral codes may be more naïve than the self-lovers, but the
codes ensure that they adopt a prudent restraint, which, paradoxically,
might enable them to fulfil their deeper desires.</p>
<p>Edmund's actions at the end of the play are incoherent in a somewhat
similar way, despite his claim to be single-mindedly ambitious. Not only
does he allow Edgar to manipulate him in to fighting a duel in a manner
which reveals the extent to which he actually respects the arbitrary
conventional hierarchy that he affects to despise (5.3.141-46; see
below), but his belated recognition of his own desire to love and be
&quot;belov'd&quot; apparently impels him to change course in the end, and
endeavour to save the lives of Lear and Cordelia (5.3.240-52). As
previously, his reductive account of his own nature, which has already
been shown to be proud rather than accurate, fails to conceal his
thwarted urge to form attachments: &quot;Some good I mean to do, despite of
my own nature&quot; (5.3.244-45; compare 1.2.1-2). Edmund, is eventually able
to prioritise his attachments over his self-love in a much more radical
way than Goneril, since he has in fact always felt the power of
sympathetic ties, if only through their absence. Overall, the portrayal
of Goneril and Edmund in the final scene suggests that although
self-love will naturally exercise an enormously disruptive influence at
times, since it is bound to culminate in political ambition, it tends to
be self-correcting in the end, since it will itself always be distorted
by the gravitational pull of attachments, which form an equally
fundamental element of the human psyche.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> The fates suffered by
these three self-lovers allow Shakespeare to show that attachments may
easily override self-love, even when they are not supported by the
salutary conventions which they have helped to generate: as one critic
puts it, &quot;man must live by the moral law, which is the bond of love, or
swiftly destroy himself.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The play as a whole therefore appears to endorse the fool's implication
that, far from defaulting either to attachment or self-love under normal
circumstances, human nature is permanently torn between these two
incompatible and quite equally matched natural forces. The reactions of
Lear's hundred knights to his change of fortune presumably reflect the
incidence of these motives in the population as a whole. Just under two
thirds of these desert Lear after his confrontation with Goneril, no
doubt because they know that necks can be broken &quot;when a great wheel
runs down a hill,&quot; indicating that in the final analysis they
&quot;follow...but for form,&quot; whereas &quot;five or six and thirty&quot; of the hundred
remain &quot;hot questrists&quot; after the king, no doubt moved by the same
combination of affection and engrained respect for authority as we find
in Kent, Gloucester and Albany (2.4.63-81, 3.7.16-20).</p>
<p>As with Lear's knights, two thirds of the servants present at
Gloucester's blinding are primarily motivated by common self-regard.
(This is not to say that the self-regard of the servants and the knights
is anywhere near as extreme as the ambition of Goneril, Regan, Cornwall
and Edmund, despite ultimately springing from the same root.) The two
compliant servants &quot;hold the chair&quot; in which Gloucester is blinded, but
subsequently admit that they are appalled by Cornwall's actions, which
they assume will be punished by the gods (3.7.67, 3.7.99-102). Hoping
perhaps to avoid a similar fate themselves, they anoint the duke's eyes
and arrange for him to be escorted from the castle by poor Tom (3.7.67,
3.7.103-07). Although these efforts to help Gloucester, however
prudently minimal, suggest that pious imperatives and residual
sympathetic ties are often enough to moderate self-love to a degree, the
servants' overall complicity in the duke's blinding indicates that these
principles are not sufficiently powerful to prevent expedient conformity
to tyranny. Nevertheless, one may infer from the servants' guilt that in
more stable times, these imperatives would encourage this stolid
majority to conform peacefully to a just regime. The sixty-four or five
knights have apparently served Lear faithfully in the past, since under
the old regime their prudent sense of expedience never came into
conflict with their codes of piety and honour.</p>
<p>By contrast with these ambivalently self-loving characters, but in
parallel to the third of Lear's knights who remain passionately loyal,
one of the three servants intercedes forcefully to protect Gloucester
from being blinded, not primarily out of sympathy for the victim, but,
ironically, because of a long-standing attachment to Cornwall himself,
who he assumes would regret his cruelty forever, both in this life and
possibly in the next (3.7.72-82). The fact that this passionately loyal
servant succeeds in killing his master, while the other two merely
conform reluctantly to his tyrannical will, suggests that political
history is forged by clashes between the great natural forces of
self-love and attachment (both personal and patriotic), whilst the
majority of the populace, who are moved by a combination of shallow
attachments and conventional codes, practise an expedient, and at times
uneasy, conformity to whatever regime is in place (3.7.95-98,
4.2.70-78).</p>
<p>Although Lear's three daughters clearly reflect the same ratio of
self-regard to dutiful and passionate attachment as the servants and the
knights, Goneril and Regan are extreme cases, which, to repeat, are
abstracted--as far as it is possible to do so--from the moderating
influence of attachments and habitual decorum in a manner designed to
expose the essential nature of self-love. Egregious narcissists of this
sort seem to be relatively rare, although Edmund's actions show that
they may pose a disproportionate threat, precisely because they tend to
be drawn to political life as the means to gain the greatest power and
distinction.</p>
<h1>The Limitations of Conventional Beliefs</h1>
<p>Using the example of astrology to disguise his exploration of religion,
Shakespeare seems to endorse Edmund's implication that piety may
encourage passivity, since it might lead people to see themselves as
&quot;villains on necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion&quot; (1.2.118-31).
<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup> Gloucester assumes that some higher power is causing &quot;love [to]
cool&quot;-- &quot;these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good for
us&quot;--perhaps as a punishment for the hubris of materialistic natural
philosophers: &quot;Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus,
yet nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects&quot; (1.2.103-09).
(This is the first hint in the play that 'enlightenment' is naturally
abhorrent to some of the just characters -see below for a fuller
analysis of these points.) Gloucester declares that &quot;we have seen the
best of our time...and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our
graves,&quot; even though the only evidence for this view seems to be the
king's unexpected <em>volte-face</em> and Edgar's alleged treachery
(1.2.112-14). He is so deeply immersed in these fatalistic ruminations
that he wearily delegates the investigation of his son's &quot;villain[y]&quot;
to Edmund, almost in a parenthesis (1.2.112-17). As well as encouraging
a fatalistic passivity, Gloucester's credulity also renders him
vulnerable to malign manipulation: Edmund intensifies his awed horror at
Edgar's alleged treachery simply by portraying the latter as &quot;mumbling
of wicked charms, conjuring the moon to stand's auspicious mistress&quot;
(2.1.39-40).</p>
<p>Gloucester's piety combines with secular codes of decorum and his
naturally moderate disposition to instil in him a deep respect for the
established hierarchy. He declares that the disguised Kent's &quot;fault is
much&quot; purely on the basis of the latter's lack of conventional
deference, but at the same time feels impelled to point out that the
stocks are an inappropriately &quot;low correction,&quot; designed only for
&quot;basest...wretches,&quot; by his fear that &quot;the king must take it ill&quot; to be
&quot;so slightly valued in his messenger&quot; (2.2.140-47). He defers at first
to the tyrannical Cornwall's &quot;fiery&quot; and &quot;unremovable&quot; will, declaring
that the latter's &quot;disposition, all the world well knows, will not be
rubb'd nor stopp'd,&quot; but only &quot;entreat[ed]&quot; (2.3.91-94, 2.2.152-54).
Later, he assumes that Cornwall and Regan will be bound by the
conventions that he himself respects even as they are preparing to blind
him, repeatedly appealing to the authority of the gods and the protocols
of hospitality (3.7.30-41). Because he himself is regulated by
sympathetic ties which are reinforced by a deep respect for established
conventions, Gloucester is slow to recognise that Cornwall himself now
feels free to ignore &quot;the form of justice,&quot; not to mention common
compassion, after realising that his new-found &quot;power&quot; has put him
beyond &quot;control&quot; (3.7.24-27).</p>
<p>In a similar way, Albany's &quot;milky gentleness,&quot; combined with his trust
in the &quot;gods that we adore,&quot; eventually induces him to defer reluctantly
to Goneril's determination to halve the number of Lear's knights
(1.4.290, 1.4.340-48). Just as Cornwall silences Gloucester with a
peremptory phrase-- &quot;I'll answer that&quot;--so Albany's early attempt to
intercede on Lear's behalf is easily overridden by Goneril: &quot;Pray you,
content&quot; (2.2.147, 1.4.311-13). Like Lear himself (see below), Albany is
slow to oppose Goneril's ambition because he sees egregious self-love as
a &quot;monstrous&quot; perversion, and can hardly believe that it could ever
completely override love and codes of duty (5.3.160). He is deeply
shocked when he does come to understand her true nature: &quot;Thou changed
and self-cover'd thing, for shame bemonster not thy feature&quot;
(4.2.62-63).</p>
<p>Like Cordelia and Lear, Albany is hampered in politics both by his
passionate attachments and his conventional moral convictions. He is
only persuaded &quot;with much ado&quot; to prioritise the defence of his kingdom
against Cordelia's troops above his dutiful and affectionate respect for
Lear, and still remains &quot;full of alteration and self-reproving&quot; even on
the eve of battle, since he cannot escape the thought that his actions
fall well short of his habitual code of &quot;honest[y]&quot; (4.5.1-3, 5.1.3-4,
5.1.23-27). In the event, however, Albany presumably acknowledges that
there was some truth in Goneril's scornful portrayal of his initial
stance as that of &quot;a moral fool, [who] sits still and cries, 'Alack,
why does he so?&quot; even as France &quot;with plum'd helm [the] state begins
to threat,&quot; since he ultimately decides to defend his kingdom
(4.2.56-59). As Kent indicates, no-one can be sure initially whether
France is indeed attempting to reinstate &quot;the old kind King&quot; at his
wife's behest, or simply taking advantage of the divisions between the
dukes to pursue a &quot;deeper,&quot; presumably more hostile and ambitious
purpose (3.1.25-34).</p>
<p>Now that he wields sovereign power, Albany does not have the luxury of
prioritising compassion for Lear and an honourable sense of duty in the
manner of Gloucester and Kent, who are prepared to ally themselves with
an invading force in order to protect their beloved master, just as Lear
himself does not have the freedom to emulate the sincerity which
Cordelia displays in the opening scene. (It is significant that if
indeed Edgar engages at all in the final conflict, it is more likely
that he takes Albany's side, since he subsequently acts as the duke's
champion: 5.3.115-23.) The contrast between Albany's vacillations and
Goneril's incisiveness suggests that the duke's pious and honourable
convictions often conflict with the reality of the political world. His
prayer that the gods should &quot;defend&quot; Cordelia is ironically juxtaposed
with the appearance of Lear holding her corpse, while his declaration at
the end of the play that &quot;all friends shall taste the wages of their
virtue&quot; is immediately refuted by the king's final outburst of
inconsolable grief (5.3.257-58, 5.3.303-305).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Kent's conventional beliefs are bound to be useful in a just
regime, since they reinforce his passionate loyalty (see below), they
can also handicap him in ways which contrast almost schematically with
the weaknesses of naturally moderate characters like Gloucester and
Albany. Just as Cordelia's moral principles impel her to refuse bluntly
to cooperate with Lear's plan in the opening scene, Kent's piety and
honour lead him to speak to the king in a direct and assertive manner
which quickly proves to be counterproductive. The parallels between the
two characters are underlined by the fact that Lear accuses both of them
of displaying &quot;pride,&quot; and highlighted by Kent's impudent appropriation
of the very term which the king uses to excoriate Cordelia's honesty to
flaunt his own noble &quot;plainness&quot;: &quot;To plainness honor's bound, when
majesty falls to folly&quot; (1.1.148-49; compare 1.1.129). Kent cannot see
that it was Cordelia's own misplaced sincerity which led Lear to abort
his plan, because he himself shares her rigid code of honour. Taken
together, the actions of Kent and Cordelia in the opening scene suggest
that, precisely because conventional codes of piety and honour work by
sublimating self-love into loyal service, they may also encourage
passionate individuals to take an overweening pride in their own
virtuous constancy, which sometimes prevents them from delivering this
service effectively.</p>
<p>Kent's disguise as a faithful commoner might suggest that he embodies
the intense loyalty which Lear's rule has clearly elicited from a large
section of the populace (1.4.27-35, 5.1.26-27). As with about a third of
the population, according to the above argument, his passionate and
dutiful respect for the king's &quot;authority&quot; renders him vulnerable once
Lear has renounced the position which allowed him to control
self-lovers, ultimately through the threat of force. Kent feels free to
criticise, not just Oswald, but Cornwall himself, because of his
habitual assumption that they will eventually have to &quot;do...respects&quot; to
&quot;the grace and person of [his] master&quot; (2.2.128-32). Having been
placed in the stocks, however, Kent himself eventually acknowledges that
his spirited intervention may have been counterproductive, admitting
ruefully and percipiently that he showed &quot;more man than wit&quot; in
challenging Oswald (2.4.42). In direct contrast to Gloucester, Kent's
characteristic assertiveness is actively enhanced by his faith in divine
justice: he believes that the &quot;intrince&quot; bonds of affection which he
accuses Oswald of undermining are &quot;holy cords,&quot; and sees Cordelia's
proposed military intervention as a &quot;miracle...&quot; which might perhaps
have been sent to compensate Lear for having forfeited &quot;heaven's
benediction&quot; (2.2.73-75, 2.2.160-66). Kent's persecution at the hands of
Cornwall hints that, while codes of piety and nobility certainly helped
to sustain Lear's authority (see below), they always did so at the
expense of concealing its fragile and arbitrary nature.</p>
<p>As Kent himself acknowledges, there is some truth in Oswald's remark
that he attacked him in their first encounter merely in order to &quot;put
upon him such a deal of man that worthied him, got praises of the King&quot;
(2.2.120-21, see also 2.4.42). In his confrontation with Oswald Kent
does indeed show a haughty pride in his own superior &quot;plainness;&quot; a term
which is again used repeatedly at this point in the play (2.2.92-113).
The irony of Kent &quot;profess[ing] to be no less than [he] seem[s],&quot;
namely an &quot;honest&quot; and &quot;plain&quot; servant who can &quot;deliver a plain message
bluntly,&quot; while all the time carefully maintaining a disguise, points
again to the fact that proud &quot;plainness&quot; is not necessarily an asset in
the political sphere (1.4.10-35).</p>
<p>In sum, although Kent undoubtedly begins to learn from his experiences,
he is encouraged by a combination of passionate attachment and
sublimated pride to confront self-love in a direct manner which,
although courageous and indeed no doubt generally effective under the
old regime, is at best counterproductive and at worst actively
dangerous, once Lear has surrendered his sovereign power. Although
Kent's imprudence is diametrically contrasted with the passivity of the
naturally moderate Gloucester, they are both shown to be vulnerable to
tyrannical ambition for the same reason, namely, that they see the
conventional codes of piety and honour to which they adhere as entirely
natural.</p>
<p>Lear's own response to his beleaguered situation combines natural
passion and conventional convictions in a similar manner to Kent and
with similar results. As well as blaming himself bitterly for his harsh
treatment of Cordelia, whose &quot;small fault...wrench'd [his] frame of
nature from the fix'd place; drew from his heart all love&quot; (1.4.266-69,
1.5.24), Lear is naturally shocked and appalled by Goneril's &quot;monster
ingratitude,&quot; which he sees as more &quot;hideous...in a child than the
sea-monster&quot; and, by implication, more &quot;disnatur'd&quot; (1.4.259-61,
1.4.281-83). He ultimately brands both his elder daughters &quot;unnatural
hags&quot; for their ingratitude and lack of filial feeling (2.4.278). Unlike
Edmund, who, as we have seen, identifies self-love as the primary law of
nature, Lear expects &quot;Nature&quot; to instil gratitude, since he knows this
sentiment to be one of the essential elements of the intimate
attachments which fulfil his own deepest needs (1.4.275; contrast
1.2.1-6). Thus, like Kent, Gloucester and Albany, Lear derives a
normative code partly from the innate imperatives of love, which he
assumes are universally understood, and therefore ignored only on rare
occasions at the expense of perverting nature.</p>
<p>Just as with Kent, however, codes of piety and honour reinforce Lear's
natural indignation: &quot;Let shame come when it will...I do not bid the
thunder--bearer shoot, nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove&quot;
(2.4.225-31). In contrast with Edmund, who feels entirely responsible
for his own fate, Lear is partly inclined to view &quot;Nature&quot; literally as
a &quot;goddess&quot; rather than merely as a convenient personification: he prays
that she might arrange for any child of Goneril's to prove &quot;a disnatur'd
torment to her&quot; (1.4.275-89; compare the analysis of 1.2.1-2 above).
This ambiguity suggests again that the tendency of the just characters
to view self-love as unnatural is supported by conventional beliefs
which merge indistinguishably with imperatives derived directly from
passionate attachments. Lear's professed hope that Regan at least will
&quot;know the offices of nature, bond of childhood, effects of courtesy,
dues of gratitude&quot; is typical of such characters in the way that it
lumps together passionate appeals to a &quot;nature&quot; which he supposes to be
more &quot;tender-hefted&quot; than Goneril's, with a reliance on his daughter's
conventional &quot;courtesy&quot; and dutiful sense that she owes him &quot;dues&quot;
(2.4.177-81). Normally, the imperatives of love and those of
conventional piety and morality combine to conceal or marginalise the
natural harshness of self-love, as is indicated by the way in which, in
the face of all the evidence, Lear manages to preserve his hope that
Regan both loves and respects him almost to the end of their long
conversation in act 2 scene 4.</p>
<p>Lear's sense that he has lost his identity-- &quot;This is not Lear&quot;--as a
result of Goneril's disrespect reflects his lack of understanding of the
superficial and arbitrary nature of his own &quot;marks of sovereignty&quot; and
of the deference which they have attracted (1.4.226-34). His ongoing
confidence in his own authority, which is the main factor that prevents
him from taking the full measure of his parlous situation, is
illustrated by his mistaken assumption that Cornwall and Regan &quot;durst
not...could not&quot; put his servant in the stocks, since this act &quot;do[es]
upon respect such outrage,&quot; and his continuing expectation that he will
be obeyed automatically whenever he &quot;commands, tends service&quot;
(2.4.12-27, 2.4.102). He is shocked and ultimately maddened by Goneril
and Regan's behaviour, partly because the dynamics of authority and
deference, which are in fact primarily conventional, have become
naturalised in his mind by habit, and perhaps indeed by the doctrine of
divine right (see the analysis of 4.6.82-87 below). Shakespeare uses
this situation to remind the audience that although the whole edifice of
a just society is ultimately sustained by an arbitrary hierarchy which
controls military force, this point is usually obscured precisely by the
conventional codes which support social cohesion. Because of his
habituation to these codes, Lear cannot understand that the only salient
point now is that he lacks the military power to take &quot;revenges&quot; on
Goneril and Regan, or on other ambitious self-lovers like Edmund: &quot;I
will do such things--what they are yet I know not, but they shall be the
terrors of the earth&quot; (2.4.279-82).</p>
<p>There are signs that Albany, who, despite his &quot;milky&quot; moderation and
piety, ultimately proves himself to be eminently capable of resisting
Goneril (4.2.29-67, 5.3.155-58)--could have been a powerful ally from
the start, if Lear had not been too distracted by his pious curses, his
shame that Goneril has the &quot;power to shake [his] manhood&quot; by reducing
him to tears, and finally his hope that Regan might allow him to resume
his royal &quot;shape,&quot; to sue for the duke's support, as he initially
intended to do (1.4.295-310). Although Lear asks Albany to &quot;speak&quot; in
regard to the disbanding of his knights, having guessed that he is
&quot;guiltless,&quot; he does not in the event give him time to do so, or indeed
even explain &quot;what's the matter&quot; (1.4.257-72, 1.4.295). Albany perhaps
would not have consented to the disbanding of Lear's knights if he had
been given a chance to examine both sides of the case, since his initial
instinct is that Goneril &quot;may fear too far&quot; (1.4.328). Although, as
noted, Albany too is initially hampered in his dealings with his
unscrupulous wife both by decorous codes and an affectionate nature, the
pious and magnanimous duke is certainly prepared to dispute the issue
with her, even at the start of the play: &quot;I cannot be so partial,
Goneril, to the great love I bear you...&quot; (1.4.310-13). However, Lear's
abrupt departure leaves his wife free to present the king's erratic
behaviour and violent curses simply as evidence of his &quot;dotage&quot;: &quot;Do you
mark that?&quot; (1.4.326-27, 1.4.310). (Needless to say, Goneril ensures
that Albany is absent when she and Regan finally divest Lear of all his
knights in act 2, scene 4.) Thus, Lear's habitual sense of his own
dignity, both as a monarch and a patriarch, prevents him from responding
prudently to Goneril's incursions.</p>
<p>Lear resembles most of the just characters in the play in combining a
loving nature with traditional codes of duty and piety, which generally
promote social cohesion. As we saw in the first section, however, he
precipitates the chaotic events of the play partly because he himself
ascribes to the convictions which prevent Cordelia from facilitating his
plan. One may infer from this point that in an ideal world rulers should
themselves be sufficiently thoughtful to dispense with such convictions,
since they are bound to compromise their capacity to promulgate the
noble lies which are needed to restrain self-love. Moreover, the events
which follow Lear's virtual abdication show that in less stable times
these conventional codes of behaviour hamper subjects as well as rulers:
precisely because the codes naturalise the political order, while
presenting self-love as a freakish monstrosity, they may encourage
passivity and fatalism on the one hand, and on the other, overconfident
self-assertion. Furthermore, as noted above, Edmund's explosive
resentment reflects the collateral damage which these conventions may
regularly cause.</p>
<h1>The Uses of Conventional Beliefs</h1>
<p>I would argue that the stormy night into which Lear and his small
company are forced to venture represents an original state of nature,
wherein humanity is fully exposed to the turbulence of self-love, which,
as the fool's song suggests, is bound to be as insistently disruptive as
&quot;the wind and the rain&quot; (3.2.74-77; see below). The hovel where the
company eventually finds shelter is a fitting symbol for the
constructions which, with all the caveats outlined in the previous
section, nevertheless ultimately serve to protect humanity from the
harsher elements of human nature. Shakespeare uses the scenes on the
heath to trace the process by which civil societies emerge, with the aid
of a political elite who, themselves often driven by codes of piety and
nobility as well as by natural patriotism, strive to control self-love
both by imposing the rule of law and by promoting the salutary beliefs
which aid social cohesion. To achieve these aims it was necessary to set
the play in primitive times, or what Schlegel calls &quot;a dreary and
barbarous age.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Contra Hobbes and the Enlightenment thinkers who followed him,
Shakespeare goes some way towards endorsing Gloucester's view that civil
society stands or falls by natural bonds, whether of romantic love,
friendship, kinship or patriotic loyalty: &quot;Love cools, friendship falls
off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
palaces, treason; and the bond crack'd 'twixt son and father&quot;
(1.2.106-09). All the characters apart from Goneril, Regan and Cornwall
can indeed be said to be swayed to some degree by this &quot;bias of nature,&quot;
as Gloucester puts it (1.2.111). Even the apparent exception of Edmund
proves the general rule, since his anger is catalysed precisely by the
baulking of his desire for &quot;a secure &quot;bond...'twixt father and son,&quot;
and, if the above argument is correct, eventually mollified by the
knowledge that he was, after all, &quot;belov'd&quot; (5.3.240).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shakespeare implies that political regimes are originally seeded by
small domestic groups, bound together by sympathetic ties and led by
patriarchs who eventually might become monarchs. Thus, Lear's
attachments lead him to progress naturally from recognising that he
himself is cold to attempting to find shelter for the fool and Kent--
&quot;Come, your hovel. Poor Fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
that's sorry yet for thee&quot;--and from there to a warm-hearted recognition
of the need to redistribute the elite's &quot;superflux&quot; of wealth to
&quot;houseless heads&quot; (3.2.68-73, 3.4.26-35). Although, as he now admits,
his elevated status has almost inevitably distracted him somewhat from
his compassionate patriotism-- &quot;O, I have ta'en too little care of this!
Take physic pomp, expose thyself to feel what wretches feel&quot;--we may
infer from the original plan for succession that his underlying
political motive has always been to protect the populace by ensuring
that the rule of law is maintained (3.4.32-34). In the state of nature,
where &quot;pomp&quot; is stripped away, the king's natural compassion is as
clearly exposed as the callousness of the self-lovers.</p>
<p>However, the process by which Lear and his small company eventually
secure shelter also implies that these burgeoning societies inevitably
come to rely on conventions of authority and deference, as a consequence
of the need to shield the circle of their attachments from the
turbulence of self-love. Without Gloucester's authority, which quickly
allows him to commandeer the hovel, Lear could only have protected his
beloved fool by relying on Kent's determination to &quot;force [the]
scanted courtesy&quot; of the &quot;hard house&quot; which has previously turned the
company away (3.2.62-67, 3.4.153, 3.4.174). Whereas Kent's effective use
of force--he returns having secured the house (3.4.1-5)--might remind us
that the authority of rulers must surely be originally defended and
subsequently underwritten by military power, Gloucester's intervention,
which ultimately renders Kent's initiative redundant, shows that this
ugly fact can normally be glossed over, once the social order has been
formed. At this point, the established hierarchy can usually override
self-love without the need for violence by invoking conventional
deference. Shakespeare implies that civilised life relies on such a
hierarchy: the house that Gloucester procures has &quot;fire and food ready&quot;
(3.4.153).</p>
<p>If houses represent the civil order itself, then it is significant that
one purpose of Lear's scheme to provide homes for &quot;houseless heads&quot;
would be to &quot;show the heavens more just&quot; than they actually are
(3.4.28-36). This order is rooted in natural attachment, just as
Gloucester believes, but established, salutary conventions are also
needed in order to facilitate the creation of a small enclave of peace
and justice. Within this enclave, civil order is supported by the
salutary belief that the cosmos is regulated by a benevolent hierarchy,
of which the king's authority is merely one aspect. The crucial role
that faith in just gods may play in reinforcing confidence in secular
laws is indicated when Lear extends his fulminations against Goneril and
Regan to include all &quot;wretch[es]&quot; who have committed &quot;undivulged
crimes,&quot; whom he hopes will &quot;tremble&quot; when they hear the storm and
&quot;cry...grace&quot; (3.2.49-59).</p>
<p>Like houses, such beliefs both ward off and partially conceal the
harshness of nature, since they deter self-love at the expense of
presenting it as a monstrous aberration. Lear recognises the need for
concealment when he suggests that Tom and he conduct their philosophical
investigations in private: he knows that it might be disruptive to ask
&quot;what is the cause of thunder,&quot; since this question implicitly casts
doubt on the existence of the divine sanctions which he himself has
previously figured in conventional fashion as &quot;all-shaking thunder&quot;
(3.4.154-60; see 3.2.6-9). Although religion is a uniquely effective way
of naturalising an artificial political order, the bogus love test is in
fact the play's central image for this process. The love test resembles
Lear's plan to &quot;show the heavens more just,&quot; in that it is designed to
reinforce this order by mendaciously portraying it as entirely sustained
by a great chain of spontaneous love.</p>
<p>The king's contorted and contradictory meditations on the storm confirm
that he too has always been sustained by a deep faith in the justice of
the gods. His first instinct is to rationalise the indiscriminate
lashings of the storm as a divine scourge of &quot;ingrateful man&quot; (3.2.1-9).
Since he cannot, however, deny that churches are being &quot;drench'd&quot; along
with everything else, and that his own &quot;old and white&quot; head is also in
danger of being &quot;singe[d],&quot; he goes on to speculate desperately that
the &quot;rain, wind, thunder, fire&quot; are in fact acting as &quot;servile
ministers&quot; to his &quot;pernicious daughters,&quot; conducting &quot;high engender'd
battles&quot; against those who are largely innocent (3.2.14-24). The
agonised tone of these meditations, which of course eventually drive him
insane, suggests that it is vital for men of Lear's temperament to find
a way of denying that they are at times &quot;more sinn'd against than
sinning,&quot; and to retain their reassuring sense that the harshness of
nature, including human callousness, is a punishment administered by
&quot;the great gods&quot; for &quot;undivulged crimes unwhipt of justice&quot;
(3.2.49-60).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Lear's insistence on staying out in the storm may indicate that
he is better equipped to confront the harshness of nature than Kent or
Gloucester (see below), he does so in order to &quot;shun&quot; the inner tumult
caused by &quot;ponder[ing] on things would hurt me more&quot; (3.4.6-25). In
other words, by exposing himself to the elements, Lear is trying to
distract himself, not only from his daughters' ingratitude, but from the
radical scepticism which it has provoked in his own soul. Lear certainly
lingers in the storm in order to discuss the nature of man and the cause
of thunder with Edgar in a quasi-philosophical manner, but, as we shall
see, rather than exploring these issues in a spirit of open-minded
curiosity, he is actually looking to reinforce his flagging faith in
divine providence (3.4.46-176).</p>
<p>At the end of the play, Lear's repeated denials that Cordelia is dead
alternate with a sporadic recognition that she will &quot;come no more,
never, never, never, never, never,&quot; and an indirect acknowledgement that
human lives and deaths have no more significance than those of &quot;a dog, a
horse, a rat&quot; (5.3.262-64, 5.3.266-68, 5.3.272-74, 5.3.306-12). One may
infer from these remarks, and from the fact that Lear now makes no
reference to an afterlife, that Cordelia's arbitrary death has finally
stripped him of the belief in divine providence which the sensitive
Edgar has sought to preserve (see below, and contrast, for instance,
4.7.44-48).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup> Like Gloucester and Kent (see below), he cannot in the
end bear to be fully exposed to &quot;the rack of this tough world&quot;
(5.3.314-16). Shakespeare implicitly endorses Edgar's effort to induce
Lear to &quot;look up,&quot; presumably to the gods, rather than repeatedly
&quot;look[ing]&quot; at Cordelia's lifeless body (5.3.311-14). As we shall see,
the shrewd Edgar sees that it is better for characters like Lear and
Gloucester to remain blind than to torture themselves in this way.</p>
<p>We may infer from the above that most just rulers need the gods, and
perhaps a belief in the afterlife, as much as their subjects, in order
to enable them to conceive of the arbitrary harshness of nature as in
some way just. Lear is perhaps typical of such rulers in that he is an
intermediate character in intellectual terms, whose world view is
circumscribed by the very conventional beliefs which his position
requires him to manipulate. The very stubbornness with which he adheres
to these beliefs--until he is finally overwhelmed by Cordelia's
death--and the desperation which he shows when he feels that they are
under threat, are signs that they played an integral role in helping him
to maintain his long and successful reign.</p>
<p>Lear is sustained, not only by his faith that secular justice is
underwritten by divine providence, but by the pride which he habitually
takes in the noble and spirited virtue that he displays as monarch and
patriarch. It is precisely this combination of motives which reinforces
his determination to resist Goneril and Regan's efforts to induce him to
stay with them as a private citizen and to relinquish his retinue of
knights. Although, as noted, he is beginning to worry that the gods may
have callously &quot;stir[red] these daughters' hearts against their
father,&quot; he nevertheless still asks them to enable him to respond to
their cruelty with &quot;noble anger&quot; (2.4.272-78). Despite having half a
mind at times to show humble &quot;patience&quot; and resign himself to being
merely a &quot;poor old man, as full of grief as age, wretched in both,&quot; his
piety, combined with his habitual abhorrence of &quot;women's weapons,
water-drops,&quot; ultimately drives him to defy Regan's advice that, &quot;being
weak,&quot; he should &quot;seem so,&quot; and instead to threaten nameless &quot;revenges,&quot;
which he hopes will be &quot;the terrors of the earth&quot; (2.4.271-84,
1.4.296-99, 2.4.201).</p>
<p>It is fortunate indeed, I would argue, that Lear does not agree to his
daughters' proposal that he should humbly apologise and henceforth &quot;be
rul'd and led&quot; by them, for although Goneril and Regan may declare
initially that they would have no reason not to &quot;receive him gladly,&quot; if
he abandoned his &quot;follower[s]&quot; and made no attempt to &quot;manage those
authorities that he hath given away,&quot; the celerity with which they
subsequently &quot;seek his death&quot; suggests that in the end they would not
have spared him and &quot;all that offer to defend him,&quot; even if he had
settled down to live with them as a private citizen in the manner which
both they and the fool advise, since he could always have served as a
focus of resistance to their own regimes (2.4.146-56, 2.4.292-93,
1.3.16-18, 3.4.162-63, 3.6.88-97). Lear is in fact in grave danger when
he does eventually fall into his daughters' hands, since, as Edmund puts
it, his &quot;title&quot; has &quot;charms&quot; &quot;to pluck the common bosom on his side&quot;
(5.3.45-54). Goneril and Regan would surely have agreed with Edmund that
the best way to &quot;defend&quot; their &quot;state&quot; is to show their father no mercy,
just as they come to see that it was &quot;great ignorance...to let
[Gloucester] live; where he arrives he moves all hearts against us&quot;
(5.1.65-69, 4.5.8-14).</p>
<p>Thus, far from valuing the humble and patient Lear who emerges in the
second half of the play,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> Shakespeare implicitly endorses the king's
original, noble sense that it would not &quot;become...the house&quot; to sue
Goneril for forgiveness and &quot;raiment, bed and food,&quot; as if he were
merely a private individual; it is in fact his proud and spirited anger,
rooted in natural passion, but encouraged by his conventional piety and
nobility, which preserves his life, since it is this that drives him out
into the stormy night, where he evades capture and execution
(2.4.153-56). Under different circumstances, this spiritedness would
certainly have driven Lear to defend his regime on the battle-field, as
the play suggests he has done countless times before (see the analysis
of 4.6.87-92 below).</p>
<p>Lear is aided by a group of characters who illustrate the nature of the
passionate and dutiful loyalty which reinforces just regimes. Kent is
moved by the same combination of attachment and convention that
motivates Gloucester and Albany, although, like his master, he is
naturally a much more assertive character (see above). It must be said
first that Kent's courageous intervention at the start of the play
reflects a deep natural attachment to Lear: he has &quot;lov'd&quot; him as a
&quot;father&quot; (1.1.140-42). Like France, who immediately offers to marry
Cordelia, even though she is now dowerless, and like Cordelia herself,
who of course later on in the play makes good her claim to provide a
level of &quot;care and duty&quot; commensurate with her &quot;love,&quot; Kent understands
that the satisfactions of deep attachments are founded on the gratitude
and trust which are generated by self-denying service: &quot;If thou canst
serve where thou standst condemn'd, so may it come, thy master, whom
thou lov'st, shall find thee full of labors&quot; (1.1.213-261, 1.1.100-02,
1.4.4-7). At the end of the play, he dissuades Edgar from attempting to
revive Lear in the compassionate hope that the king's heart will
&quot;break,&quot; and then, having refused the crown, declares that he sees no
point in living on without his ruling passion: &quot;My master calls me&quot;
(5.3.3.312-323). (It is the measure of Kent's sympathetic connection
with Lear that it enables him, uniquely in the play, to confront and
welcome a harsh truth, namely that the king is dead, which the robust
and percipient Edgar denies.)</p>
<p>Kent's initial willingness to risk banishment is thus typical of a life
&quot;held but as a pawn to wage against [Lear's] enemies;&quot; one which he
&quot;never fear'd to lose,&quot; the king's &quot;safety being motive&quot; (1.1.155-81).
Kent's passionate and utterly self-denying determination to protect the
king is particularly evident in the storm scenes (3.2.60-67, 3.4.1-5,
3.4.22, 3.4.125, 3.4.156, 3.4.175, 3.6.4-5, 3.6.33-34, 3.6.58-59,
3.6.82, 3.6.97-101). Overall, he can therefore be classed among the not
inconsiderable number of characters in the play who naturally prioritise
their attachments, both personal and patriotic, over their self-love; a
list which of course includes Lear himself, who at the start of the play
also wishes to surrender the crown in order to focus on his &quot;joy&quot;
(1.1.82).</p>
<p>However, although Kent's intervention in the opening scene shows that
his love goes well beyond dutiful &quot;allegiance,&quot; he is able to serve Lear
with such robust loyalty, albeit with the naivety noted in the section
above, precisely because he also relies on the support of a set of
artificial convictions (1.1.167). He has certainly &quot;lov'd [Lear] as a
father,&quot; but he has also &quot;ever honor'd [him] as [his] king,&quot;
&quot;follow'd&quot; him as his &quot;master,&quot; and &quot;thought on [him] in [his]
prayers&quot; as his &quot;great patron&quot; (1.1.140-42). In direct contrast to
Goneril, Kent offers Lear &quot;service&quot; and &quot;call[s] [him] master&quot;
partly because he continues to see &quot;authority&quot; in his &quot;countenance,&quot;
even after the king has forfeited all means of compelling obedience
(compare 1.3.16-18 and 1.4.23-30). His insistence on addressing Lear as
&quot;your Grace&quot; on the heath reminds us of the robustness of this instilled
respect, just as the latter's sardonic response, &quot;What's he?&quot; implies
that the king is beginning to strip away these conventions (3.4.125-26;
see below for Lear's 'enlightenment').</p>
<p>Kent's sense of duty is underwritten by his piety: he prays that &quot;the
gods&quot; will take Cordelia &quot;to their dear shelter,&quot; recognising that she
&quot;justly think[s],&quot; and &quot;fear[s] judgment&quot; (1.1.182-83; see also
1.4.16-17, 3.6.5). Like Gloucester, Kent expresses a belief that the
callousness of self-love must in some way stem from &quot;the stars above us,
[which] govern our conditions,&quot; having clearly been moved by the
gentleman's pious description of Cordelia shaking &quot;holy water from her
heavenly eyes&quot; (4.3.29-35). His passionate loyalty is thus reinforced
not only by his habitual, proud sense of his own nobility, as noted in
the section above, but by his belief that offences against the natural
imperatives of love are perverse or monstrous aberrations inspired by a
malign supernatural influence.</p>
<p>Similarly, when Gloucester helps Lear at enormous personal risk, having
been ordered not to &quot;sustain him&quot; in any way, he is motivated not only
by natural pity and a passionate revulsion against Cornwall and Regan's
&quot;unnatural&quot; callousness, but by a habitual respect for the hierarchy
over which &quot;the King my old master&quot; has presided (3.3.1-19). He protects
Lear sturdily, not merely out of a natural sympathy for his &quot;poor old
heart,&quot; but because the king is &quot;anointed&quot; (3.7.56-66). Gloucester may
be unassertive by nature, but his code of duty ultimately proves to be
as robust as Kent's: &quot;my duty cannot suffer t'obey in all your
daughters' hard commands&quot; (3.4.148-53). His astrological theories are
used to hint that conventional piety may reinforce just regimes by
presenting them as reflecting an overarching, supernatural order. If
higher powers occasionally cause &quot;love [to] cool,&quot; then they are
presumably imagined as working to sustain attachments the rest of the
time (1.2.103-09). Gloucester is himself sustained later in his brave
resistance to Cornwall by his faith in &quot;the kind gods,&quot; and his hope
that they will deliver a &quot;winged vengeance&quot; (3.7.35, 3.7.92, 3.7.66). As
we shall see in a later section, Gloucester resembles Lear in that his
faith in the justice of the gods is absolutely vital to his well-being.
Overall, he and Kent embody the robust combination of passionate ties
and conventional beliefs which has doubtless formed the foundation of
Lear's long and just rule.</p>
<p>Albany also belongs with the large group of characters whose strong
natural attachments are supported by conventional conceptions of
duty<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup>: his &quot;reverence&quot; for Lear as &quot;a father and a gracious aged
man&quot; merges imperceptibly with his compassion and his spontaneous
gratitude to the king for having &quot;benefited&quot; him with the title of
&quot;prince&quot; (4.2.41-45). He hopes that the gods will send &quot;visible
spirits...to tame these vild offenses,&quot; and later sees the deaths of
Cornwall, Goneril and Regan as representing the &quot;judgment of the
heavens, that makes us tremble,&quot; since it &quot;our nether crimes so speedily
can venge,&quot; while his passionate sympathy for Cordelia expresses itself
as a prayer that the gods should &quot;defend&quot; her (4.2.46-47, 5.3.232,
4.2.78-80, 5.3.257). As with Gloucester and Kent, this combination of
natural and conventional motives reinforces Albany's loyal sense of duty
and determination to see justice done wherever possible (5.3.297-305).</p>
<p>If the storm on the heath represents the natural harshness of self-love,
Kent's ultimate inability to confront this harshness, illustrated at the
end of the play by the way in which &quot;the strings of his life began to
crack&quot; as he told &quot;the most piteous tale of Lear and him,&quot; is implicitly
reflected in his repeated, urgent injunctions to the king to enter the
hovel which he has just commandeered, on the grounds that &quot;man's nature
cannot carry th' affliction nor the fear&quot; of the storm, and that &quot;the
tyranny of the open night's too rough for nature to endure&quot; (5.3.216-18,
3.2.48-49, 3.2.60-67, 3.4.1-5, 3.4.22; see also 4.7.95-96).</p>
<p>By exposing the grave consequences of enlightenment, the play suggests
that the opinions which blind the just characters to the arbitrary
harshness of nature are vital for their well-being. The moderate Albany
survives the events of the play only by turning away from their
harshness: at the end of the play, he begs Edgar to &quot;hold it in&quot; if he
has more to tell, since he is already &quot;almost ready to dissolve&quot; after
hearing about Gloucester's death (5.3.203-05).</p>
<p>Gloucester himself, who, having lost his faith in the justice of the
gods, can only be prevented from ending his own life by Edgar's
fraudulent 'proof' of divine intervention (see below), is as insistent
as Kent that the company should find shelter from the storm (3.4.148-53,
3.4.170-4). His casual response to Edgar's unusually frank remark that
&quot;ripeness is all,&quot; which implies that nothing, perhaps not even the will
of the gods, should be valued above natural fulfilment, suggests that
the pious duke could never be supported by philosophical thought: &quot;And
that's true too&quot; (5.2.8-11). <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup> The manner of Gloucester's demise
might remind us again of his need for the gods: when Edgar, perhaps in a
moment of weakness, finally tells him the full truth of their
&quot;pilgrimage&quot; &quot;from first to last,&quot; no doubt including a sober account of
the subterfuge by which he restored his father's faith, the confession
immediately causes the duke's &quot;flaw'd&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; heart to &quot;burst,&quot;
partly from &quot;joy,&quot; but also from &quot;grief,&quot; for Edgar has restored the
possibility that the gods might be unjust (5.3.196-200). Free-thinking
is anathema to Gloucester: he believes that &quot;the wisdom of nature
[which] can reason it thus and thus,&quot; will be &quot;scourg'd&quot; for its
hubristic presumption (1.2.104-06).</p>
<p>Lear's imaginary trial of his daughters could be seen as the last,
desperate flowering of the noble, dignified self-assertion which seems
to have characterised the king throughout his long and just reign (see
below). As well as offering him personal reassurance, his barely
retained faith in the justice of the gods is potentially politically
useful, since it is presumably a factor in his determination to bring
Goneril and Regan to trial. I would argue that Lear's &quot;arraign[ment]&quot;
of his daughters, which of course audiences are encouraged to dismiss as
completely deluded, is in fact covertly used to explore the underlying
nature of legal institutions (3.6.20-54). This is a crucial section of
the play, since the principal task of a just ruler is arguably to uphold
the rule of law. Indeed, the progression from the state of nature to
civil order which Shakespeare seems to outline in the scenes on the
heath could be said to culminate in this imaginary trial. Lear's suit is
typical of legal processes in that it sublimates the natural
vengefulness which in fact remains his underlying motive into a measured
and organised effort to deliver retribution: it is significant that even
in his current state of turmoil, the king separates the judiciary from
the executive, appointing a stranger as a principal judge, while himself
merely adopting the role of plaintiff (3.6.36-48). In Lear's mind he
could actually be said to be engaging in a dignified and moderate public
process--he addresses what he imagines to be an &quot;honorable assembly&quot;--in
a manner which, under normal circumstances, would be calculated to
reinforce respect for the law (3.6.47).</p>
<p>If the symbolic interpretation of houses and storms given above is
correct, then the very fact that Lear waits to &quot;arraign&quot; his daughters
until he is in the well-appointed house procured by Gloucester, shielded
from the stormy night, may be seen as insinuating that the law itself is
based on a set of useful illusions. Not only is Lear's faith in the law
reinforced by his piety, but the arbitrary nature of his decision to
appoint Tom and the fool to preside at the court might remind us that
the wisdom of judges is not always commensurate with their power
(3.6.36-39). Most crucially, Shakespeare also suggests that the very
legal processes which are designed to control self-love must necessarily
disguise its true nature. As we have seen, the portrayal of Goneril and
Regan seems to support the fool's implication that it makes no more
sense to hold extreme self-lovers responsible for their actions, as if
they were free moral agents, than it does for Lear to inveigh against
the storm, since the attachments upon which conventional moral codes are
ultimately founded are, in the case of Lear's elder daughters, so
radically stunted as to render them automatically and unthinkingly
self-regarding. I would argue that this point is conveyed symbolically
here by the fact that the offenders whom Lear thinks that he is trying
are in fact merely &quot;join-stool[s]&quot; (3.6.52). Lear's determination to
give his daughters a fair trial is therefore based on a fantasy in a
deeper sense than the one that is immediately obvious, since, as he
begins to realise at this point, Goneril and Regan are naturally
&quot;warp'd,&quot; just like the wood which was originally used to construct the
stools (3.6.53-54).</p>
<p>Thus, if pursued in a thoroughly philosophical manner, the plan that
Lear forms after experiencing this epiphany to &quot;anatomize Regan; see
what breeds about her heart,&quot; in order to understand &quot;the cause in
nature that make[s] these hard hearts,&quot; would have ultimately led him
to see that his elder daughters are simply natural hazards, who must be
destroyed or disabled in the same manner as one would a &quot;wolf,&quot; to use
the fool's image (3.6.76-78, see 3.6.18-19). Arguably, however, the law
may only continue to provide the deterrents which are needed to protect
society from the savagery of self-love if this truth remains hidden,
since legal processes are bound to be driven primarily by a desire to
deliver retribution, a motive which assumes that moral responsibility is
intrinsic to the human condition.</p>
<p>Overall, the scenes on the heath show that, although civil society is
rooted in sympathetic attachments, it must rely on an artificial
hierarchy to protect these attachments from the disruptive influence of
self-love. Conventional codes of piety and nobility reinforce the
compassion and spirited self-assertion of the rulers who emerge in
response to this need, while at the same time inculcating principles of
dutiful deference in the populace at large. These codes support social
cohesion, most notably by presenting secular authority as mirroring a
divine order. Thus, the very process of controlling self-love naturally
involves disguising its harshness, as when law courts attribute moral
responsibility to those who are no freer to emulate the just characters
than &quot;warp'd&quot; stools. The dissemination and preservation of these
salutary conventions are facilitated by the fact that most passionate
and just individuals are naturally disposed to avoid &quot;look[ing]&quot; at
the arbitrary harshness of the universe, as is indicated by the anguish
which they feel when they are forced to do so.</p>
<h1>The Natural Ruler</h1>
<p>Lear's effective abdication at the start of the play, along with Kent
and Albany's refusal of the crown at the end, might suggest that
political engagement is incompatible with personal fulfilment.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup> We
may infer that, despite his innately sympathetic nature, Lear can only
have been induced to rule for so long by his habitual nobility and
piety, since it is clear from the opening scene that he naturally
prefers trusting personal attachments to the hypocritical displays of
political life. Ironically, his position has prevented him from devoting
himself fully to his personal &quot;joy,&quot; even as it enables him to play a
vital role in maintaining the stable civic order which frees his
subjects to pursue their own lasting attachments. It is this imbalance
which sparks the resentment which Lear feels when Cordelia prioritises
sincere feeling over the accommodations which politics inevitably
demands.</p>
<p>However, I would argue that the philosophical Edgar is used to show that
truly thoughtful and passionate individuals may nevertheless actively
wish to engage in politics, and, moreover, that they may do so in a
particularly effective way, since they understand the need for noble
lies and the strategies by which they may be preserved and disseminated.
In the state of nature which Lear's abdication precipitates, Edgar
quickly emerges as a natural ruler, by virtue both of his sympathetic
disposition and his shrewd intelligence. Shakespeare implies that the
process by which civil order is established in Britain is not complete
until the philosophical Edgar tacitly accepts Albany's offer of the
crown at the end of the play (5.3.320-27; see below). Edgar, that is,
the actual Anglo-Saxon king of that name, was generally held up as a
model for successive monarchs in Shakespeare's time in the way that he
united and civilised a previously barbarous nation. Flahiff argues that
&quot;the prospects for Lear's kingdom are contained in Edgar's name,&quot; as
surely as if he had been called Arthur.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup> Certainly, Lear has
temporarily united the country, but, as the opening scene reveals, this
union is based on an uneasy balance of power, whereas at the end of the
play Edgar is given the chance to impose the laws and disseminate the
conventions upon which the whole nation will be founded. From one point
of view, <em>King Lear</em> can therefore be seen as the first of the history
plays.</p>
<p>Unlike the other just characters, Edgar resists the unjust characters
effectively, because he too is radically emancipated from conventional
opinion. If Edmund raises the subject of astrology with his brother in
the hope that the latter might be induced to resign himself
fatalistically to his father's sudden hostility, he must be disappointed
by Edgar's incredulous response (1.2.136-51). Even as Edmund dismisses
Edgar as hopelessly naïve, he is shrewd enough to draw a careful
distinction between &quot;a credulous father and a brother noble, whose
nature is so far from doing harms that he suspects none&quot; (1.2.179-81).
Edgar is indeed not naturally &quot;credulous,&quot; as Edmund implicitly
acknowledges here, and although he is initially vulnerable to his
brother's ploys, purely because such schemes are so alien to his
passionate nature, he quickly shows himself to be much more astute and
resilient than his pious father. In contrast to the fatalistic
Gloucester, he immediately finds a mundane and entirely accurate
explanation for his predicament, which allows him to react in a manner
which is both measured and--ultimately--spirited: &quot;Some villain hath
done me wrong&quot; (compare 1.2.165 and 1.2.103-17).</p>
<p>Unlike Lear, Kent and Gloucester, Edgar &quot;embrace[s]&quot; the storm,
signifying his ability to accept fully and confront the innate harshness
of self-love, &quot;welcom[ing]&quot; his torments simply because he has
apparently already reached the lowest point possible (4.1.1-9). After
the shock of seeing his disfigured father for the first time, even he
has a momentary urge to pray to the gods, but having quickly composed
himself, he falls back on his own resources in characteristic fashion
(4.1.25-28). By contrast to Gloucester, Edgar has a wiry robustness
which is the mark of a particularly passionate and intelligent nature.
The fact that he is moved more deeply by Gloucester's condition than his
own suggests that he derives this strength from his attachments rather
than simply from his instinct for survival (4.1.10-12, 4.1.25-28). <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup>
It is significant that in the third of Edgar's four incarnations, as the
poor peasant who sees Gloucester's miraculous preservation, he describes
himself as &quot;by the art of known and feeling sorrows...pregnant to good
pity&quot; (4.6.222-23).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup> Thus, although Shakespeare adopts Plato's
distinction between the few who are sustained entirely by natural desire
and the many who are partly or wholly reliant on convention, he
disagrees with his intuitions regarding the ultimate good: Edgar is
deeply thoughtful, but he is ultimately led by his attachments rather
than his desire for knowledge.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup></p>
<p>After admitting that his &quot;tears begin to take [Lear's] part so much,
they mar my counterfeiting,&quot; Edgar goes on to reflect on the personal
benefits which accrue to those who are capable of feeling intense
sympathetic concern:</p>
<p>&quot;When we our betters see bearing our woes,</p>
<p>We scarcely think our miseries our foes.</p>
<p>Who alone suffers, suffers most i' th' mind,</p>
<p>Leaving free things and happy shows behind,</p>
<p>But then the mind much sufferance does o'erskip,</p>
<p>When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.&quot;</p>
<p>(3.6.102-07, see also 3.6.60, 3.6.57)</p>
<p>Those who are regulated by a truly passionate desire to form sympathetic
connections may well be touched by the suffering even of relative
strangers, albeit no doubt less intensely than that of friends and
family. (Edgar responds to Lear simply as a fellow human being, without
mentioning that he is the king's godson -2.1.91). They can make their
own pain &quot;light and portable&quot; by establishing such connections, and,
furthermore, because attachments are intrinsically fulfilling, gain
permanent access to &quot;free things and happy shows.&quot;</p>
<p>Shakespeare uses this important soliloquy to suggest that the few who
are able to align themselves with their own deeper needs naturally
exploit every opportunity to develop a sense of compassionate solidarity
with their fellow men. It is highly significant that in Edgar's case,
this impulse seems to culminate in his willing acceptance of the crown
at the end of the play (5.3.320-27). This is not to say that Edgar loses
sight of the supreme value of personal relationships. He clearly feels a
much deeper sympathy for his father than he does for Lear, since, as we
shall see, he applies himself much more concertedly to the task of
restoring Gloucester's faith in the gods (compare 4.1.25-28 and
3.6.60-61; see 3.6.74-75 and 3.6.110-15 for his decision to leave Lear).
However, we may infer that he also sees sovereignty as an opportunity to
give free rein to his sympathetic nature, which he knows will sustain
him amidst the endemic insincerity of political life.</p>
<p>Edgar's putative, voluntary accession to the throne at the end of the
play, which reflects a natural hierarchy of passion and intellect,
corrects the pessimism of the play's opening, in which Lear is neither
willing to continue his own relatively compassionate reign, nor in the
end able to pass on the crown to a daughter who is also naturally
tender-hearted. Although, in Shakespeare's scheme, by contrast with that
of Plato, philosophers do not have to be forced into politics, the
corollary of the compassionate Edgar's ability to appreciate the
intrinsic rewards of sovereignty is that intermediate characters like
Lear, who are less likely to develop such an appreciation precisely
because their natural sympathy for their subjects is at times
overshadowed by the insubstantial gratifications of &quot;pomp,&quot; do indeed
need to be impelled to rule by noble lies, just in the manner that Plato
envisaged (3.4.28-36).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although Edgar himself inevitably benefits from the secure order which
conventional beliefs generate, as is implied by the fact that he too
shelters in the hut, despite his relatively insouciant attitude to the
storm, he can manipulate these beliefs at least as effectively as
Edmund.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup> (The parallel between the two brothers in this respect is
underlined by the way in which Edmund exhorts himself to &quot;sigh like Tom
o' Bedlam&quot;: 1.2.135-36). Edgar certainly uses his disguise as poor Tom
to preserve his own life, but his various manipulations are usually
motivated primarily by compassion. Even as he begs from Lear, he is
exerting himself to soothe the king's bitter sense that the gods are
unjust (3.4.51-61, 3.6.29-32; this point is explored at length below).
Similarly, although he &quot;enforc[es]...charity&quot; from &quot;poor pelting
villages...sometimes with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,&quot; just as
shamelessly as Edmund manipulated his credulous father by describing his
brother as &quot;conjuring the moon&quot; through &quot;wicked charms,&quot; his pious
deceptions are also likely to benefit the villagers by reminding them
that heaven ultimately rewards generosity and punishes self-love
(2.3.17-20, 2.1.38-40). Overall, Edgar's determination to reassure both
Lear and Gloucester as to the existence of divine providence shows that
there are forces within human nature which are capable of
counterbalancing the wiliness of ambitious self-lovers.</p>
<p>It is significant that Edgar is able &quot;with presented nakedness [to]
outface the winds and persecutions of the sky,&quot; once he has decided to
disguise himself as a lunatic in order to avoid capture (2.3.11-12). He
survives, and ultimately thrives, precisely because he abandons his
gentlemanly status and all his conventional values without a second
thought: &quot;Edgar I nothing am&quot; (2.3.21). He is intelligent and passionate
enough to liberate himself completely from pride, whether in its raw or
its sublimated form: not only is he absolutely unambitious, but, unlike
Lear, Cordelia or Kent, he is neither noble nor pious.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup> Clothes are
used alongside houses to represent the conventional opinions and
institutions which shield the majority of the populace from the
harshness of self-love at the cost of disguising its true nature.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup>
Just as it becomes second nature to live in houses and wear clothes in a
civilised society, so we have seen that the codes which instil
moderation and respect for the established hierarchy are readily
naturalised in the eyes of the populace and indeed most of the elite,
partly through simple habit and partly by being presented as part of a
divine order. Clothes are apt symbols for such codes: not only do they
protect the body from the harshness of nature by concealing its
&quot;sham[eful]&quot; drives, which are inalienably private and hence
potentially divisive (3.4.65-66), but, being such rigid class signifiers
at the time, they may easily be used to represent the conventional
hierarchy: Regan is typical in that her robes are indications of her
status as well as a means to keep her &quot;warm&quot; (2.4.264-70).</p>
<p>As Lear inadvertently implies, his wish to maintain a train of knights
after he has surrendered power could be compared to Regan's desire to
wear &quot;gorgeous&quot; clothes, presumably because it is in part an expression
of his desire for &quot;pomp&quot; (2.4.260-70, 3.4.33). Like clothes, however,
Lear's knights also help to ward off the harshness of nature: the king's
retinue reinforces his authority, partly through the simple threat of
military force, and partly by concealing the fact that he is in reality
nothing more than &quot;a poor, bare, fork'd animal&quot; without these &quot;lendings&quot;
(3.4.106-09). Thus, both clothes and Lear's knights are used to suggest
that the established opinions and institutions by which society protects
itself from self-love are ultimately manifestations of pride, in however
sublimated a form.</p>
<p>Edgar's accession completes Shakespeare's analysis of the process by
which just regimes develop from the state of nature. His regime, unlike
Lear's, is bound to be absolutely just, at least in its conception,
since his passionate and thoughtful nature has enabled him to subjugate
his pride completely, so that a desire for &quot;pomp&quot; could never distract
him from his compassionate patriotism. Precisely because Edgar is
indifferent himself to the various manifestations of sublimated pride
which reinforce political authority, he can exploit them in a prudent
and flexible manner. His manipulation of Lear and Gloucester (see below)
suggests not only that the most passionate and thoughtful individuals
will experience a spontaneous desire to care for the non-philosophical
majority, but that this care naturally tends to express itself as a
concern to reinforce confidence in divine providence.</p>
<p>At the end of the play, Edgar also shows that he can control self-lovers
by manipulating their pride. There is no self-serving reason for Edgar
to confront Edmund, nor is there any sign that his primary purpose is
revenge: he apparently has no plans to fight his brother if Cordelia's
forces are victorious (5.1.40-46). Although, in a fair simulation of
noble indignation, he censures Edmund equally for being &quot;false to thy
gods, thy brother, and thy father&quot; and &quot;conspirant 'gainst this high
illustrious prince,&quot; his main aim at this point is probably to prevent
Edmund from doing any further damage to the kingdom, while showing the
assembled company that injustice will inevitably be punished
(5.1.135-36; see below).</p>
<p>Edgar challenges Edmund in a manner which conforms to chivalric
convention as closely as possible under such unconventional
circumstances (5.3.121-31). In accordance with the conventions of the
period, he settles on formal, public combat as an effective substitute
for a trial. As previously, his ability to manipulate established codes
is symbolised by a change of clothing: he now conceals his true identity
beneath an anonymous suit of armour (compare 4.1.44-45). He carefully
justifies his challenge as conforming to the code of knighthood, when in
fact his anonymity would normally bar him from the lists, and manages to
goad the proud Edmund into retaliating when there was strictly no need
to do so by demeaning him in front of the assembled crowd (5.3.131-51).
In a sense the wily Goneril is therefore right to claim that Edmund is
&quot;not vanquish'd, but cozen'd and beguil'd&quot; (5.3.152-55).</p>
<p>The manner of Edgar's defeat of Edmund suggests that the ability of
philosophers to distinguish between nature and convention allows them to
work to support the established order in the most flexible and effective
manner possible, whilst at the same time indicating that ambitious
self-lovers are less free than they suppose. Philosophers can emancipate
themselves from convention even more radically than self-lovers, since
they are likely to remain unmoved by the insubstantial gratifications of
social status, as well indifferent to pious or noble convictions. In the
end, Edgar exploits Edmund's proud desire for distinction as effectively
as the latter exploited Gloucester's credulity.</p>
<p>Edgar is equally disingenuous in the manner that he uses Gloucester's
story to reinforce the piety of the large and varied company which has
observed the duel, just as he worked to reinvigorate the faith of Lear
and Gloucester (see below):</p>
<p>&quot;The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices</p>
<p>Make instruments to plague us:</p>
<p>The dark and vicious place where thee he got</p>
<p>Cost him his eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>(5.3.171-74)</p>
<p>His claim at the end of the play to &quot;speak what we feel, not what we
ought to say&quot; is similarly disingenuous, since he includes himself among
the &quot;young&quot; who &quot;shall never see so much&quot; as the old, despite the fact
that he has actually been betrayed in as egregious a manner as
Gloucester and Lear (5.3.325). This inconsistency implies that his
intention at this point is by no means to &quot;speak what [he] feel[s],&quot;
as he claims, but rather to build a sense of solidarity with his new
subjects, as he attempts to shift their attention towards the prospect
of a serene future, and away from the horrors of internal dissension and
civil war, and perhaps also away from the tenuousness of his own claim
to the throne (see 4.5.9-11, 5.1.21-7, 5.3.45-59). Even if we take his
statement at face value, it implies that he is only temporarily
&quot;obey[ing]&quot; the requirement to &quot;speak what we feel&quot; because of &quot;the
weight of this sad time,&quot; and that from now on his public remarks will
be much more discreet and measured (5.3.24-25). Thus, over the course of
the play Edgar shows that he can manipulate both the ambition of the
self-lovers and the piety of the just characters with equal facility. I
would suggest that he represents the ideal ruler in the way that he
combines intense compassion, which provides him with a natural motive to
rule, with a shrewd, strategic intelligence.</p>
<p>As we have seen, whereas Edgar willingly accepts the crown at the end of
the play, Lear, Kent and Albany all eschew political rule at some point
in the play (see 5.3.299-301, 5.3.320-23).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup> Albany's ambivalence
over whether to oppose the king's forces is paralleled by Lear's
simmering frustration with the ignoble insincerity which his role
demands; a frustration which finally boils over when Cordelia shows her
contempt for his machinations, while at the same time proudly displaying
her own passionate sincerity. Both are hampered as they strive to
accommodate themselves to the demands of political life, not merely by
their personal attachments, but by their codes of piety and honour.
These codes may help such characters to rule for long periods, as the
example of Lear shows, but they also aggravate their natural distaste
for the disingenuousness which is an essential element of politics. By
contrast, Edgar shows that on rare occasions politics may be regulated
entirely by nature.</p>
<p>Although Edgar will doubtless be able to form deep attachments, even he
could never fully reconcile these with the demands of public life.
Shakespeare uses the actions of France--who, it should be recalled, has
married Cordelia purely out of love (1.1.238-41, 1.1.250-61)--to
underline this tension in a particularly stark manner. Although France's
invasion does indeed appear to be motivated simply by a compassionate
desire to help Cordelia to reinstate Lear, rather than by &quot;ambition&quot;--
&quot;my mourning and importun'd tears [he] hath pitied&quot; (4.4.23-29)--he is
forced to desert his wife just before the battle with the British
troops, leaving his marshal behind to lead his forces, because he has
detected a threat which &quot;imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger
that his personal return was most requir'd&quot; (4.3.1-8). This decision may
well contribute to Cordelia's defeat, and therefore to her eventual
death. We may infer from this example that in extremis all just
political leaders may need to prioritise their compassionate patriotism
over their most intimate personal relationships. However, it is
significant that Shakespeare relegates this caveat to the margins of the
main narrative. Under more normal circumstances, rulers will simply have
to negotiate carefully between personal and political considerations:
thus, Lear has clearly had time to develop his attachment to Cordelia,
not to mention the fool, despite the constraints of his position.</p>
<h1>The Threat from Philosophy</h1>
<p>Even as Lear is conducting his imaginary trial, there are signs that his
confidence in secular justice is being undermined. He relegates the
proudly spirited Kent to the position of third judge, and appoints Tom
and the fool to preside as first and second judges respectively, despite
the fact that their teachings are, as I shall argue, equally detrimental
both to robust legal processes and even ultimately to political
authority itself (3.6.36-39).</p>
<p>As noted above, the natural desire for retribution which drives Kent
and, for the first half of the play, Lear, is founded on the belief that
injustice is a perverse and wilful aberration from imperatives which all
are naturally primed to obey. As we have seen, however, the fool
implicitly contradicts this view early on in the play, advising Lear
that self-love is a primal force of nature, as powerful and as
imponderable as those which created the Pleiades (1.5.34-36, see above).
On the heath he declares &quot;he's mad that trusts in the tameness of a
wolf...or a whore's oath&quot; (3.6.18-19). It is significant that it is the
fool who points out that the defendants in the imaginary trial are in
fact &quot;join-stool[s]&quot; (3.6.52). He answers Tom's lyric, &quot;Come o'er the
bourn, Bessy, to me,&quot; which is presumably an oblique reference to Lear's
alienation from his daughters, with a verse which explains that she
&quot;dares not come over to thee&quot; because &quot;her boat hath a leak,&quot; thus
perhaps suggesting that the hard-heartedness of Goneril and Regan is as
natural as sexual desire and pregnancy (3.6.25-28).</p>
<p>Far from seeking to deny the arbitrary force of self-love, as do most of
the other characters, the fool is willing to linger in &quot;a brave night,&quot;
which &quot;pities neither wise men nor fools,&quot; in order to deliver his
cynical mock prophecy (3.2.79, 3.2.12-13). This 'prophecy,' delivered on
the heath at the height of the storm, brackets self-love and incontinent
desire together as forces which routinely and unavoidably disrupt
society and degrade attachments (3.2.80-94). In the fool's view, both
the established authorities and the institutions which might enable them
to restrain self-love, are in fact themselves constantly in danger of
being corrupted by it: the legal system is frequently abused, while
priests and &quot;nobles&quot; are often too distracted by their own pompous or
lavish displays to instil or model piety and honour. Thus, in some
respects, the fool's view of the world resembles that of the
Machiavellian Edmund, who defines human nature as primarily
self-regarding (1.2.1-2).</p>
<p>When seen in the light of the balanced judgement which is adumbrated by
the play as a whole, the fool's account seems overly pessimistic. There
is nothing in the play to suggest, as the fool does, that self-love
cannot be systematically restrained by deterrents, despite its
deeply-rooted nature. It is, after all, only when Lear gives up his
sovereign power that the problems begin. The fool's analysis of human
nature may be skewed by his own prudent fearfulness: having reluctantly
submitted to Lear's repeated request that he should explore the hovel,
he is terrified by the semi-naked Edgar, whom he mistakes for an evil
&quot;spirit&quot; (3.4.39-43). This may suggest that, rather than being genuinely
philosophical, his stance of disillusioned scepticism is as likely to
create terrors where none exist as poor Tom's superstition; the only
difference being that, rather than fabricating a supernatural sphere,
his demonising vision is superimposed upon humanity.</p>
<p>It follows from the fool's pessimistic view of society that thoughtful
individuals should concentrate on guarding themselves against the
inevitable threats posed by self-love and on restraining the proud and
sensual elements within their own nature: usurers, for instance, cannot
&quot;tell their gold i' th' field,&quot; but must strive to acquire houses in
order to protect themselves from &quot;cutpurses,&quot; as well as from the &quot;the
wind and the rain&quot; (3.2.90-91, 3.2.75). It is only in the fool's mock
utopia that &quot;going shall be us'd with feet;&quot; in the real world, as he
advised earlier, prudent travellers will &quot;ride more than [they] go...&quot;
(3.2.93-94, 1.4.121). Those who are able to &quot;spy into&quot; what may be
impossible to &quot;smell out&quot; thoroughly, will see that self-love is a
deeply rooted and potentially dominant element within human nature, and
so will emulate the snail, who &quot;put[s] 's head&quot; in his own &quot;house&quot; and
&quot;keep[s] in a' door&quot; (1.5.19-31, 1.4.125). The fool himself summarises
his key teachings thus: &quot;Have more than thou showest, speak less than
thou knowest...Leave thy drink and thy whore, and keep in a' door&quot;
(1.4.117-28).</p>
<p>The fool illustrates the need to resist both the internal and the
external threats posed by self-love through his cautionary tale of a man
who is forever tormented by a self-regarding wife as a result of his
sexual incontinence (3.2.27-34). (Goneril, Regan and Edmund's
relationships later on in the play support Shakespeare's recurring
implication that self-love usually goes hand in hand with such
incontinence, even though the two motives are in essence completely
distinct: &quot;for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a
glass&quot; -3.2.35-36.) He prefaces this anecdote by repeating his earlier
recommendation to emulate the snail: &quot;He that has a house to put's head
in has a good head-piece&quot; (1.4.125, 1.5.27-31, 3.2.25-26). Thus, it is
the fool who introduces the symbolic association between houses and
humanity's efforts to keep the turbulence of self-love at bay, just as
it is left to the fool to compare that turbulence explicitly to &quot;the
wind and the rain&quot; (3.2.75). Typically, however, he applies the image
solely to the personal sphere, where his prudent advice may indeed be
useful to some extent, and ignores the role that social constructs may
play in restraining self-love.</p>
<p>The astute fool blames Lear, not for his determination to transfer his
power in itself, but for having &quot;par'd [his] wit o' both sides, and
left nothing i' th' middle&quot; (1.4.187-88). As Lear himself seems guiltily
to realise, the fool is probably hinting that he approved of the
original plan for succession when he points to the benefits of
&quot;keep[ing] one's eyes on either side's nose&quot; (1.5.19-23). Rather than
questioning Lear's use of the love test, the fool simply, and perhaps
justifiably, criticises him for failing to exploit Cordelia's unexpected
bluntness, echoing the fateful conversation with bitter precision: &quot;Can
you make no use of nothing, nuncle?&quot; (1.4.130-31). However, it is
typical of the apolitical fool to care about this plan only insofar as
it affects himself and those whom he holds dear: he refers to the
kingdom as Lear's &quot;land,&quot; his &quot;living&quot; and his &quot;case,&quot; as if he were
merely talking about the domestic affairs of a private citizen
(1.4.134-35, 1.4.107, 1.4.141, 1.5.31). As his mock prophecy shows, he
has no faith in the power of political institutions to create a just
regime, whereas one of the aims of the king's original plan was, as we
have seen, to secure order in the country as a whole.</p>
<p>The fool's belief that attempts to control the predations of self-love
are bound to be futile leads him to criticise Lear's spirited, dignified
assertiveness. When Lear starts to wonder whether he should attempt &quot;to
take... [his kingdom] again perforce,&quot; the fool promptly reprimands
him for not being as &quot;wise&quot; as he is old (1.5.39-45). His claim that
Goneril and Regan could only ever be expected to possess the superficial
&quot;tameness of a wolf&quot; is presumably intended to dampen the spirited
longing which Lear has just expressed for &quot;a thousand with red burning
spits [to] come hizzing in upon 'em&quot; (3.6.15-19). He even advises Lear
to use his &quot;tine wit&quot; to &quot;make content with his fortunes fit,&quot; and
administer &quot;court holy water&quot;--that is, abject flattery--to his
daughters in order to secure &quot;a dry house&quot; (3.2.74-77, 3.2.10-13). As we
have seen, such a retreat would actually have been highly dangerous,
even, perhaps, if Lear had renounced all pretensions to sovereignty,
since his daughters subsequently waste no time in &quot;seek[ing] his
death&quot; (3.4.164). Unbeknownst to the fool, who is clearly more naïve
than he thinks despite his philosophical disposition, political and,
ultimately, military engagement is in fact the only means of
safeguarding the security of the very domestic enclaves to which he
advises Lear to retreat.</p>
<p>The fool's advice that Lear should simply &quot;make content with his
fortunes fit,&quot; conflicts, not only with the king's natural revulsion
against filial ingratitude, but with the piety and dignified nobility
which have been vital driving forces in his long and successful reign.
As with Cordelia, whom Lear refers to posthumously as his &quot;poor fool,&quot;
the fool's very bluntness is also symptomatic of a broader lack of
concern with politics (5.3.306). He consistently undermines the
conventional convictions which have helped to sustain Lear's regime,
criticising his code of honour and, by implication, in his remark about
the Pleiades, his pious beliefs (2.1.34-37). The fool does not
apparently grasp the absolute nature of the disjunction between those
who can withstand, and even relish &quot;ponder[ing]&quot; the harshest truths,
and those who flinch away from them (3.4.24). He thus perhaps speaks
more truly than he knows when he exclaims that he should &quot;learn to lie&quot;
(1.4.179-80). By contrast, Shakespeare himself disguises the harsh truth
that egregious self-love is an entirely natural phenomenon by
encouraging audiences to focus on, and sympathise with, Lear's moral
indignation, while overlooking the fool's own sceptical contributions,
which are disguised as trivial banter.</p>
<p>Like Plato, the fool also questions whether there is any natural motive
to induce a thoughtful individual to rule. His lamentation that a king
should blindly play &quot;bo-peep, and go the fools among,&quot; suggests both
that Goneril and Regan are in one sense more percipient than Lear,
presumably because, according to the fool's perspective, they understand
that politics is essentially driven by self-love rather than passion or
morality, and that they are nevertheless still &quot;fools&quot; in a deeper
sense, presumably because they do not understand that they can reap no
substantial benefits from &quot;snatching&quot; power (1.4.175-78, 1.4.152-58).
The fool goes further than this, however: by inverting the real
situation-- &quot;this fellow has banish'd two on 's daughters, and did the
third a blessing against his will&quot;--he insinuates that just rulers are
as unlikely to find political engagement intrinsically satisfying as the
unjust (1.4.102-03).</p>
<p>Certainly, as we have seen, Lear's agonising over whether to act on his
preference for Albany over Cornwall, his desire to give up his
sovereignty in order to retire to Cordelia's &quot;nursery,&quot; and the bogus
love test itself all point to genuine tensions between political and
personal life. However, while acknowledging these tensions--and indeed
exploring them in detail--Shakespeare does not in the end endorse the
fool's view that political life offers no substantial, intrinsic rewards
(see the previous section). One could never imagine the fool valuing his
connections with a whole community, as Edgar does when he asserts that
one may be &quot;free and happy&quot; in the face of suffering, &quot;when grief hath
mates, and bearing fellowship,&quot; or even as Lear does when he is
proposing to house &quot;poor naked wretches&quot; (3.6.102-10, 3.4.28-36). The
fool apparently has no conception of the satisfaction which patriotic
statesmen may gain from a just and compassionate stewardship of the
country which they love.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to note at this point that the fool does not stay with
Lear to the bitter end. Although he is certainly capable of forming
close attachments--he has &quot;pin'd away&quot; since the departure of
Cordelia--he has always been keenly aware of the folly of &quot;taking one's
part that's out of favor&quot;: if &quot;thou canst not smile as the wind sits,
thou'lt catch cold shortly&quot; (1.4.73-74, 1.4.99-101). Since he also
reunderstands the real value of attachments, the fool is clearly aware
that &quot;the knave turns fool who runs away,&quot; but his sceptical
intelligence also reminds him constantly that a &quot;wise man [would] fly&quot;
from the now powerless king, lest he &quot;break [his] neck with following&quot;
(2.4.67-87). One may infer that he simply deserts Lear in the end from
the fact that he twice lags behind in a manner which suggests that he is
indeed looking for a way to &quot;smile as the wind sits&quot;: not only does he
remain with Goneril, after the king has ordered all his servants to
depart, until she threatens him with &quot;a halter,&quot; but, just before he
vanishes completely, he has to be ordered somewhat brusquely by Kent to
help carry the king to Dover - &quot;thou must not stay behind&quot; (1.4.314-21,
3.6.100-01).</p>
<p>Like Edmund's cynicism, the fool's inconstancy shows that a philosophy
which does not take its bearings by deep attachments is likely to be
founded, erroneously, on the assumption that self-love is the driving
force in the human psyche. Shakespeare would no doubt extend this
criticism to much modern thought (see below). The fool's understanding
of politics is limited because he underrates the capacity of forces
which are ultimately rooted in attachment to oppose self-love. He does
not see that political engagement, even with all the hypocrisies and
accommodations which it inevitably entails, may still be motivated by
compassionate patriotism, and therefore carry its own intrinsic rewards.
Lacking the truly deep attachments which would have inspired total
loyalty, the fool would perhaps have been of more use to Lear if he had
simply shared the conventional beliefs which reinforce Kent and
Gloucester's intransigent fidelity.</p>
<p>From the start, a part of Lear is open to the fool's teachings in a
manner which again suggests that, although the king is by no means a
philosopher, he is more thoughtful than most of the other noble
characters: his ambivalent attitude to these teachings is highlighted
when, after initially threatening to &quot;whip&quot; the fool for pointing out
the imprudence of giving one's &quot;living&quot; to ambitious daughters, he
subsequently threatens to have him &quot;whipt&quot; for lying rather than
delivering the bitter truth in full (compare 1.4.110 and 1.4.181).
Lear's appointment of the fool as second judge is the first of many
indications that the king has absorbed enough of his sceptical thought
to be weakened as a political leader. I will argue that the fool's
teachings are one of the factors that ultimately lead the king to
question his previously robust faith in the power of social conventions
and established institutions to control self-love.</p>
<h1>The Uses and Limitations of Christianity</h1>
<p>Tom's theology is similarly apolitical, in that it offers no promise
that secular justice is either modelled on, or supplemented by, divine
judgement. Rather than being punished by God for breaking his oaths in
&quot;the sweet face of heaven&quot; and for &quot;serv[ing]...the lust of [his]
mistress' heart,&quot; Tom has simply exposed himself through pride and lust
to &quot;the foul fiend['s]&quot; opportunistic temptations (3.4.85-94,
3.4.51-58, 3.4.129-41). By contrast with the demon which is portrayed as
proactively guiding Gloucester to his destruction, all Tom's fiend can
do is lead him randomly &quot;through fire and through flame, through ford
and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire,&quot; while simply ensuring that
&quot;knives,&quot; &quot;halters&quot; and &quot;ratsbane&quot; are rather more easily available to
him than they would have been anyway (3.4.51-55; compare 4.6.66-74).
Where he might appear more influential, he could be seen simply as a
ruefully sardonic personification of Tom's own youthful arrogance: the
fiend &quot;made him proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over
four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor&quot;
(3.4.55-58).</p>
<p>Although Tom presents demonic forces as immanent in the world--he
brackets together &quot;whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking&quot; (presumably by
witchcraft)<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup>--their influence is not only relatively trivial, but
could be explained entirely naturalistically. Tom draws little
distinction between &quot;the cold wind&quot; and the baneful influence of &quot;the
foul fiend&quot; (3.4.59-60, 3.4.46-47, 3.4.96-99), or between studying to
&quot;prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin&quot;: it is difficult to tell whether
he is being &quot;vex[ed]&quot; by lice or demons when he suddenly declares,
&quot;There could I have him now--and there--and there again--and there&quot;
(3.4.159, 3.4.61-62).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup> Similarly, &quot;the foul fiend Flippertigibbet&quot;
turns out merely to cause cataracts, squinting, hare-lip and mildew, and
to &quot;hurt...&quot; only &quot;the poor creature of earth,&quot; while Hoppedance simply
seems to be a convenient personification of Tom's hunger (3.4.115-19,
3.6.30-32).</p>
<p>Crucially, in contrast with his later manipulation of Gloucester, Edgar
makes no reference at all to angelic interventions when talking to Lear
(compare 4.6.49-74). In Tom's fourth song, which he sings after being
appointed principal judge in Lear's imaginary trial, a role which he
promises to perform &quot;justly,&quot; the speaker could be seen as implying,
with understandable obliqueness, that secular justice is no longer
supported by an immanent providence: &quot;Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly
shepherd?&quot; (3.6.40-44). In the song, the errant sheep, a stock image of
course for sinful humanity, have no-one immediately at hand to protect
them after straying &quot;in the corn,&quot; but must simply rely on the promise
of salvation: &quot;And for one blast of thy minikin mouth, thy sheep shall
take no harm.&quot; In Protestant theology in particular, supernatural
interventions are often pared down to a single cataclysmic event at the
end of time, when Christ will return to redeem original sin.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus, according to most Protestant doctrine, humankind must strive to
resist the depredations of self-love simply through their faith, without
the immediate aid of divine providence. In the first of Tom's songs--all
of which should be read with particular care, I would argue, since
Shakespeare tends to conceal his most provocative thoughts in the most
seemingly trivial and random passages--St. Withold is portrayed as
attempting to banish a demon purely by the force of his words: he &quot;bid
her alight, and her troth plight, and aroint thee, witch&quot; (3.4.120-24).
It is significant that we never learn whether his invocation is
successful. Similarly, in his fifth song, Tom repeatedly promises to
chase off the fierce dogs which the demented king has confused with his
predatory daughters simply by &quot;throw[ing] his head at them&quot;
(3.6.64-73). I would argue that this particularly obscure phrase refers
to faith in the power of Christ, which reassures believers that sin has
already been defeated in the great scheme of things: &quot;Dogs leapt the
hatch, and all are fled&quot; (3.4.73). This eschatological interpretation
explains the strange mixture of tenses in Tom's song: he says nothing in
the present tense, but first promises that he &quot;will throw his head at
them,&quot; and then asserts that the dogs have already &quot;fled.&quot; The fact that
Tom only promises to intercede with his &quot;head&quot; might prompt the reader
to compare the purely intellectual nature of the reassurances which Tom
offers Lear to the absolutely concrete &quot;miracle&quot; which he concocts to
confirm Gloucester's belief in the direct influence of supernatural
forces, both demonic and angelic (4.6.55, 4.6.69-79).</p>
<p>Priests might reassure their flocks that Christ has already intervened
in order ultimately to redeem sin and end all suffering, but, since they
are likely to preach that their &quot;jolly shepherd&quot; has not yet reawakened
from &quot;sleep,&quot; it seems doubtful that these doctrines could ever deter
sinners as effectively as &quot;the great gods&quot; whom Lear has previously
invoked, whose thunderous retribution is consistently capable of making
the vicious &quot;tremble&quot; and &quot;shake&quot; (3.2.49-59). In the end Tom himself
seems to admit that his response to the unruly dogs is ineffectual:
&quot;Poor Tom, thy horn is dry&quot; (3.4.74-75). However, despite the weaknesses
of these doctrines when considered strictly from a political
perspective, in terms of their power to control self-love, they arguably
represent the most powerful means possible of justifying the ways of God
on an individual level. Rather than stretching the evidence to argue
that arbitrary tribulations represent personalised divine puishments,
Christian theology justifies all suffering as precipitated by original
sin: &quot;Thy sheep be in the corn&quot; (3.4.42).</p>
<p>Protestantism in particular often justifies this rationalisation of
suffering by extending the concept of sin to include states of mind and
spiritual impulses. In concrete terms the worst that Tom seems to have
done was to drink, gamble, dress fashionably, borrow heavily and
&quot;serv[e] the lusts of my mistress' heart&quot; (3.4.85-97). At the start of
his potted spiritual autobiography, however, he foregrounds pride as the
underlying vice which has exposed him to the fiends: he was a
&quot;servingman...proud in heart and mind&quot; (3.4.80-85). His distorted echo
of Lear's condemnation of his &quot;pelican daughters,&quot; which comes close to
converting &quot;pelican&quot; into 'peacock,' a traditional emblem of pride and
lust, suggests that, rather than dwelling on the faults of others, the
king should focus his attention on his own self-love: &quot;Pillicock sat on
Pillicock-Hill&quot; (3.4.70-77). By adding a final injunction, &quot;set not thy
sweet heart on proud array,&quot; to the traditional Mosaic commandments
against swearing, adultery and filial disobedience, Tom reflects the way
in which the ten commandments, which relate entirely to behaviour, are
supplemented and indeed frequently superseded in the Christian tradition
by a new concern with the state of the &quot;heart&quot; (3.4.80-83).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup> The
psychological version of original sin invoked by Edgar as poor Tom, in
which pride itself becomes the chief enemy, regardless of whether it
exerts any substantial influence on external behaviour, provides a
particularly effective means of reconciling arbitrary suffering with
divine providence, for no-one can justifiably claim to be &quot;more sinn'd
against than sinning,&quot; once the concept of sin has been extended to
include the inner promptings of self-love (3.2.59-60).</p>
<p>Deeply disturbed by his sense that there is &quot;corruption&quot; in the court,
which was itself triggered by his recognition that Regan is naturally
&quot;warp'd,&quot; Lear appears to take Edgar's song about the dogs as an
invitation to replace the trial of his daughters with a more
philosophical approach: as we have seen, he now wishes to &quot;anatomize
Regan; see what breeds about her heart. Is there any cause in nature
that make these hard hearts?&quot; (3.6.52-56, 3.6.76-78). Since sin is now
seen as universal, it seems both futile and unjust to single out
individuals for punishment, especially as political and legal
institutions are themselves bound to suffer from endemic &quot;corruption.&quot;
Lear's original god, the thunder-wielding Jove, who modelled a robust,
dignified assertion of authority and supplemented secular justice with
divine rewards and sanctions (2.4.227-28, 3.2.49-59), is now replaced by
a more remote and cerebral theology, wherein alienation from &quot;the sweet
face of heaven&quot; becomes the only substantial sin, which automatically
triggers its own internal torments (3.4.89). Once faith in direct divine
retribution has been abandoned, with all the support that this used to
offer to secular laws, and replaced with an approach which prioritises
an inner spiritual alignment with Christ, analysis of the psychology of
&quot;hard hearts,&quot; who resist the power of His potentially redemptive love,
may easily come to be valued above the political and legal institutions
which play such a vital role in protecting society against the
depredations of self-love.</p>
<p>Although Tom's teachings do not directly satisfy Lear's desire to see
Goneril and Regan punished by the gods for their callous actions, he
clearly finds them deeply appealing--as is shown by his eager questions
and his repeated insistence that his interlocutor is a profound
philosopher (3.4.154-58, 3.4.171-72, 3.4.175-76)--since they restore his
faith in divine justice, albeit arguably at the expense of extending the
concept of sin until it becomes useless for political and legal
purposes. It is no criticism of Edgar to argue, as I have done above,
that his Christian teachings degrade Lear's capacity to rule: having no
knowledge of Cordelia's military action, he has understandably
determined to treat Lear as a private citizen rather than as a king.
(The fool could of course be defended in the same way, although, as we
have seen, he tends to side-line political considerations anyway.)
Indeed, Edgar achieves a remarkable feat in soothing Lear so quickly and
so deeply. Although clearly deranged, the king is relatively peaceful
almost throughout the second half of the play. Edgar seems to understand
that, precisely because Christianity psychologises and universalises
sin, while limiting divine intervention to a single redemptive act, it
may preserve faith in a divine order in the face of all kinds of
injustice and adversity. His success in alleviating Lear's suffering may
be taken to indicate that these doctrines have their uses when they are
widely accepted by the populace, but, as we shall see, the play
implicitly argues that they should certainly not be adopted by the
ruling elite.</p>
<p>After Lear's respectful responses have convinced Edgar that he has
succeeded in restoring the king's faith in the justice of the gods in
the manner described above, he compares himself to Child Roland in the
old Scottish fairy story, who is forced to kill a simulacrum of his
sister in order to free her from &quot;the dark tower&quot; of the elf lord
(3.4.182). This analogy might suggest, among other things, that Edgar
has had to overcome his own reluctance to dismantle the artificial self
which has been forged by Lear's conventional nobility and piety in order
to soothe the king's anger so successfully. Like Roland, Edgar must
restrain not only his hunger, but, in the short term, his natural pity
in order to fulfil this compassionate mission.</p>
<p>Edgar then implicitly compares himself to the giant in 'Jack and the
Beanstalk,' making a slight, but potentially significant change to the
famous chant: &quot;His word was still, 'Fie, foh, and fum, I smell the blood
of a British man'&quot; (3.4.183-84). Despite his compunction, Edgar is
prepared to sacrifice Lear the statesman, who, as we have seen, was able
to unite, not just England, but the whole of Britain under his reign,
having recognised that the king could only be reconciled to his bitter
lot through a Christian conversion. If this interpretation is correct,
then the astute Edgar is shown to be as sensitively attuned to the
potential tensions between Christian doctrine and political authority as
Shakespeare himself. He understands that the new Lear will be closer to
the natural man, as the story of Child Roland implies, for Christianity
may well encourage the sincere personal attachments which he and
Cordelia instinctively value, but at the same time that the politically
useful, simulated version of the king, compounded partly of piety and
dignified nobility, which has ruled successfully for so many years, will
be lost forever.</p>
<p>Lear's enquiries are not genuinely philosophical, although his repeated
use of the term may point to the way in which philosophy and Christian
theology work together to dismantle his former convictions (see below):
he is driven to ask Tom to explain &quot;the cause of thunder&quot; by a desire to
confirm his faith in divine providence rather than by disinterested
curiosity regarding the nature of the universe (3.4.155). If Tom
answered, as some Protestant theologians might, that thunder is an
arbitrary manifestation of a fallen world, in which humanity has
divorced itself from God and therefore surrendered itself to mechanical
processes, then his teaching could easily merge in Lear's mind with the
fool's sceptical materialism. In this way the doctrine of <em>deus
absconditus</em> which Protestantism popularised could be seen as ushering
in the Enlightenment.</p>
<p>If, as I have argued, clothes are used in the same way as houses, to
represent social conventions which simultaneously protect and
conceal,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup> then the king's view of Tom as &quot;the thing itself,&quot; namely
&quot;unaccommodated man [who] is no more but such a poor, bare, fork'd
animal,&quot; is flawed, for Edgar has actually &quot;reserv'd a blanket, else we
had been all sham'd&quot; (3.4.102-08, 3.4.66). The blanket is an apt symbol
for the quasi-philosophical nature of Protestantism, which strips away a
superstitious belief in demonic and celestial intervention and accepts
that self-love is endemic, but ultimately makes these concessions purely
in order to reinforce faith in divine providence. Having &quot;reserv'd&quot; a
belief in divine justice by reducing it to this residual form, these
doctrines manage effectively to conceal the &quot;sham[eful]&quot; truth that
nature is arbitrary, and hence often unjust. Far from presenting
self-love as unnatural and beyond the pale, as traditional religions
might have done, such doctrines can only achieve their end by actively
exaggerating its influence.</p>
<p>Lear has little understanding of the essential nature of humanity,
despite symbolically &quot;<em>tearing off</em>&quot; his clothes (3.4.108-09). Although
he later interrupts his attempt to discover whether there is &quot;any cause
in nature that make these hard hearts&quot; to demand in effect that Edgar
remove even his blanket, he does not realise that the latter would be
left naked if he complied, but sees himself simply as toning down
&quot;Persian&quot; luxury (3.6.76-81). Lear would in fact be &quot;sham'd&quot; by the
truth which he thinks he wants to pursue should it ever be uncovered by
his &quot;anatomiz[ing],&quot; since, although he may by now have abandoned his
hope that divine providence might intervene to punish his daughters, he
is still fundamentally sustained by his faith. He welcomes Edgar's
account of his spiritual journey, because he longs to believe that he
himself also has an immortal soul which is playing a significant role in
a cosmic struggle between divine and diabolic forces, even though this
struggle is removed from the quotidian world.</p>
<p>It is possible that there is an allusion to the dualism which underpins
Christian accounts of the human condition hidden in the fool's
comparison of Gloucester's sudden entrance, bearing &quot;a little fire in a
wild field,&quot; to &quot;an old lecher's heart,&quot; which has &quot;a small spark, all
the rest on's body cold,&quot; for, according to conventional scholastic
teaching, a soul is indeed a sort of &quot;walking fire,&quot; since it
constitutes the vital &quot;spark&quot; that animates the base mechanism of the
body (3.4.110-14). It may be significant that when Lear finally
countenances the possibility that Cordelia's soul is as irremediably
dead as her body, he &quot;undo[es] a button&quot; (5.3.307-10).</p>
<p>Lear's choice of his two principal judges is thus deeply ironic, since
they both hold views which tend to undermine faith in legal processes,
albeit for very different reasons. Lacking a passionate concern for the
welfare of his fellow countrymen, and believing that self-love is too
deeply rooted in society to be controlled by legal deterrents, the fool
concentrates on self-protection, while his--accurate--understanding that
self-love naturally predominates in certain individuals is incompatible
with the very premise upon which retributive justice is founded. On his
part, Tom can only reassure Lear that the heavens are just by shifting
the theatre of the struggle against self-love to the individual psyche,
which in a fallen world can do no more than rely humbly on the mercy of
a loving God. Neither Tom nor the fool believe in the stern traditional
gods which Lear has previously sought to invoke, whose interventions
could reinforce secular sanctions and model proud and passionate
retribution. In sum, there is in practice less difference between Tom's
version of piety and the fool's sceptical philosophy than one might have
imagined, despite the ideological gulf between the two, since both
advise Lear that he must focus constantly on moderating his own
self-love in a manner which directs him away from his spirited urge to
confront it in others.</p>
<p>By contrast, Kent, who is relegated to the position of third judge,
provides the most prominent example in the play of the power of assured,
noble indignation (2.2.9-43). Ironically, the spirited Kent is much more
suited to the administration of justice than either of his 'superiors'
in Lear's imaginary court, since, as his treatment of Oswald in act 2,
scene 2 shows, he believes whole-heartedly both in delivering
retribution and in his own moral superiority to those whom he condemns.
As we have seen, he is certainly vulnerable to the encroachments of
ambitious narcissists after Lear's effective abdication, but only
because he is slow to realise that he has now lost the authority to
administer such retribution effectively. Overall, Kent therefore
represents precisely the sturdy qualities which Lear eschews after his
'enlightenment'.</p>
<h1>The Uses and Limitations of Traditional Piety</h1>
<p>Shakespeare explores the strengths and weaknesses of Christianity,
considered as a political religion, in comparison to classical
religions, or religions based on the Old Testament, by inviting us to
contrast Edgar's 'conversion' of Lear with his treatment of Gloucester.
His decision to set the play in a primitive era allows us to imagine
that Edgar can choose freely between the two. By chance, Edgar is
witness to an exchange in which the blind and desperate duke repels an
old man, a tenant &quot;these fourscore years,&quot; who is anxious to help him,
presumably out of a mixture of &quot;ancient love&quot; and habitual respect: &quot;thy
comforts can do me no good at all&quot; (4.1.12-16, 4.1.43). After hearing
this he realises that, as with Lear himself, he cannot cure his father's
despair in an entirely natural way, simply by revealing his identity and
attempting to &quot;comfort...&quot; him. Gloucester is neither intelligent nor
passionate enough to emulate Edgar's own natural resilience.</p>
<p>Gloucester undoubtedly possesses a sympathetic nature: he declines his
old tenant's help partly because the latter may be &quot;hurt&quot; if he is found
in his master's company (4.1.17). At the same time, he invests just
actions with a cosmic significance, since they both conform to, and are
supplemented by, the will of the gods (see above). Even as he generously
gives Edgar his purse, hoping that his own &quot;wretched[ness]&quot; will at
least make his helper &quot;the happier,&quot; he prays that the &quot;heavens [will]
deal so still,&quot; and by the same token, punish &quot;the superfluous and
lust-dieted man, that slaves your ordinance, that will not see because
he does not feel,&quot; so that &quot;distribution should undo excess, and each
man have enough&quot; (4.1.65-71). Later he prays that his natural gratitude
to the disguised Edgar for showing him the way will be supplemented by
&quot;the bounty and the benison of heaven&quot; (4.6.224-26).</p>
<p>However, although Gloucester hopes against hope that the &quot;heavens
[will] deal so still,&quot; his undeserved suffering has now led him to
worry that men might be as insignificant as &quot;flies&quot; or &quot;worm[s]&quot; in
the eyes of the gods (4.1.33-37). Like Lear, he shies away from atheism,
but cannot escape the thought that the gods might simply be callously
indifferent to his fate (compare 3.2.19-24). Indeed, the piety of the
prayer quoted above is itself partially undermined by his very
generosity to Edgar, which he implicitly presents as a corrective to
this callousness: &quot;Here, take this purse, thou whom the heav'ns' plagues
have humbled to all strokes&quot; (4.1.64-65). As he explains in another
deeply devout prayer to the &quot;mighty gods,&quot; the motive for his attempted
suicide is itself pious, for to live on would be to &quot;fall to quarrel
with your great opposeless wills&quot; (4.6.34-40). The extent of
Gloucester's reliance on his faith is illustrated by the extreme lengths
to which he is prepared to go in order to protect it from his own bitter
anger. He cannot accept that his suffering is simply an arbitrary result
of the natural harshness of self-love, and, despite his doubts, clings
desperately to the conventional doctrines which persuade him that the
universe is just. His blinding is thus symbolic, since his reassuring
vision of the world as the theatre of a cosmic battle between good and
evil prevents him from seeing the true nature of the struggle between
attachments and self-love.</p>
<p>Edgar sees no reason not to attempt to &quot;cure&quot; Gloucester's urge to
destroy himself by manipulating his conventional beliefs, since it is in
large part triggered by the loss of these very beliefs (compare
4.6.33-34). He convinces his father that a fiend has been facilitating
his attempted suicide, and that he has only been saved by a heavenly
&quot;miracle&quot; (4.6.49-74). This ruse induces Gloucester to vow to &quot;remember&quot;
his faith in a divine order and to determine henceforth to &quot;bear
affliction&quot; patiently, praying that the &quot;ever-gentle gods&quot; should &quot;let
not my worser spirit tempt me again to die before you please&quot;
(4.6.75-79, 4.6.217-19). Thus, Gloucester's story again implies that it
is possible for thoughtful individuals to fortify the credulous against
the arbitrary harshness of nature by reinforcing their faith in a just
providence.</p>
<p>In contrast with the account which he gave Lear, Edgar now portrays both
heavenly and demonic powers as constantly intervening in the material
world in significant ways. Whereas Christianity, at least in most of its
Protestant variants, could be seen as a quasi-philosophical religion,
since it acknowledges that self-love is endemic and that divine forces
are not immanent in the world, the traditional faith that Edgar seeks to
reinforce in Gloucester is straightforwardly credulous. Shakespeare
hints at this distinction through the sartorial symbolism which I have
argued runs throughout the play: whereas Tom's naked body is largely,
though not entirely, exposed in his initial incarnation, he is fully
dressed when he convinces his father that he has been deceived by a
fiend and saved by a miraculous intervention from the gods (3.4.65-66,
4.1.44-50). It is particularly appropriate that the protean Edgar
dresses as a peasant at this point, since his account of the fiend draws
on popular superstition. (By contrast, he wears armour when he is
exploiting chivalric convention: 5.3.143.)</p>
<p>Whereas with Lear, Edgar invents fiends whose interventions are random
and relatively trivial, and indeed could easily be interpreted simply as
natural events, Gloucester's demon is presented as making a concerted
effort to help him to commit suicide (compare 3.4.51-58, 3.4.115-19 with
4.6.66-68). Moreover, whereas the former were nebulous beings, hardly
more than personifications of pride, despair and hunger (see above), the
latter is absolutely concrete, with eyes like &quot;two full moons; he had a
thousand noses, horns welk'd and waved like the enridged sea&quot; (compare
3.4.55-56, 3.6.30-32 with 4.6.69-74). Crucially, moreover, whereas in
Tom's earlier account, Flippertigibbet was opposed only by the
injunctions of a human saint, Gloucester's fiend is now apparently
frustrated by a direct divine intervention (compare 4.6.49-55, 4.6.73-74
with 3.4.120-24).</p>
<p>Rather than exhorting Gloucester's &quot;sweet heart&quot; to learn humility, as
with Lear, Tom now concentrates simply on sinful actions, which he
implies are inevitably punished by fiends. The five fiends which he
lists, namely Obidicut, Hobbididence, Mahu, Modo and Flippertigibbet,
oversee the incitement and the punishment of lust, dumbness, stealing,
murder, and the &quot;mopping and mowing [of] chambermaids and
waiting-women&quot; respectively (4.1.58-63). The same fiends which Edgar
previously portrayed as encouraging spiritual conditions such as pride
or despair are now presented as concerning themselves entirely with
vicious behaviour (see 3.4.51-61). Whereas Edgar reminded the company
that &quot;the prince of darkness is a gentleman... Modo he's called, and
Mahu,&quot; when he was striving to persuade Lear that the primary sin is
pride, he now asserts that Mahu and Modo preside over &quot;stealing&quot; and
&quot;murder&quot; respectively (3.4.143-44).</p>
<p>Edgar uses his account of the five demons to adumbrate a point which he
makes more clearly after Gloucester's death, namely that the duke's
&quot;dark and vicious&quot; affairs were fittingly punished by gods, who &quot;are
just, and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us&quot; (see
5.3.171-74). The first and last of the demons on Tom's list of
tormentors could be seen as alluding tactfully to Gloucester's
&quot;lust[ful]&quot; siring of Edmund, since the &quot;mopping and mowing&quot; refers
particularly to the flirtations of &quot;chambermaids and waiting-women&quot;
(4.1.62-63). Similarly, Hobbididence's ascribed role as &quot;prince of
dumbness&quot; is probably an allusion to the duke's attempt to marginalise
Edmund by keeping him &quot;out nine years&quot; (4.1.59-60, 1.1.32-33). The
&quot;stealing&quot; and &quot;murder&quot; over which Mahu and Modo preside are surely
references to Edmund's plan to succeed to the dukedom himself, after
effectively committing fratricide (4.1.60-61). It is typical of Edgar to
use Edmund's crimes, which were of course provoked in an entirely
mundane way by his brother's enforced &quot;dumbness,&quot; and ultimately caused
simply by Gloucester's incontinence and his subsequent shame, as
evidence for the justice of the gods.</p>
<p>Edgar's list of the demons which have allegedly been tormenting him
seems to go some way towards restoring his father's faith in heavenly
justice: Gloucester immediately prays to the heavens that &quot;the
superfluous and lust-dieted man, that slaves your ordinance...[should]
feel your pow'r quickly&quot; (4.1.67-69). It is a relatively easy task to
persuade him that he is being punished by heaven, because, unlike Lear,
he has actually committed what could be construed as &quot;a dark and
vicious&quot; sin. Later, Gloucester's new determination to &quot;bear
affliction,&quot; after being preserved by the apparent &quot;miracle,&quot; presumably
reflects his acceptance that his blinding and exposure to the fiend were
just punishments for his lust and subsequent repression of Edmund, as
well as his gratitude to the gods for ultimately extending their mercy
(4.6.55, 4.6.75-77). Overall, the creed which Edgar seeks to reinforce
in his father seems closer to classical religions and the Abrahamic
faiths than the New Testament, and perhaps closer to Catholicism that
Protestantism, since it concerns itself with penalising actions rather
than modulating spiritual states, while at the same time portraying
supernatural forces as directly and consistently interceding in the
world, both to punish wrongdoers and, presumably, to reward virtue.</p>
<p>Traditional piety of the sort which Edgar seeks to instil in his father
is certainly presented as broadly beneficial, since it enables the
credulous to endure all sorts of arbitrary tribulations. However, it is
significant that, by contrast with his treatment of Lear, which, as we
have seen, effectively reconciled the king to his lot, Edgar never fully
succeeds in arming his father against &quot;affliction.&quot; Despite Gloucester's
initial determination to &quot;bear&quot; his pain stoically after his miraculous
rescue, each new material setback inevitably offers him further evidence
of the endemic nature of cruelty and injustice (4.6.230-31, 4.6.279-84,
5.2.5-8). The duke's frequent relapses into despair suggest that
traditional religions can never entirely explain away the arbitrary
injustices which their adherents are bound to encounter in the natural
course of events.</p>
<p>Lear sets Edgar even greater problems than Gloucester, because he is
both more thoughtful and less sinful than the duke. This is probably why
Edgar decides to preach a Protestant version of Christianity in the
scenes on the heath, in which faith overshadows works and sin is almost
identified with the pride which has led humanity to reject a merciful
God. However, as we have already seen, although this approach is a
uniquely powerful way of justifying the ways of God to man on a personal
level, it does so at some political cost. Lear gains emotional
reassurance at the expense of losing the confident determination to
enforce the law which has no doubt made him such a successful ruler (see
the section below for a fuller treatment of this point), whereas
Gloucester's artificially enhanced belief in divine intervention would
not have interfered with the duke's capacity to rule justly, if he had
ever regained his dukedom. Directly after having his own traditional
faith in divine justice restored, Gloucester understandably dismisses as
deranged the sceptical humility which leads Lear to &quot;preach&quot; that the
only appropriate response to &quot;this great stage of fools&quot; is to weep like
a child (4.6.178-83, 4.6.279).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus, Edgar's contrasting approaches to Lear and Gloucester serve to
highlight, in an understandably veiled way, the strengths and weaknesses
of Christianity as a political religion in comparison to classical or
Mosaic faiths, or even Roman Catholicism. The doctrines of original sin
and <em>Deus absconditus</em> may combine to provide a supremely effective way
of convincing the populace as a whole that the heavens are just, but
they undermine some of the basic assumptions which have traditionally
sustained both the legal system and, as we shall see in the next
section, even political authority itself. Shakespeare's overall
implication is that rulers themselves should either be thoroughly
enlightened in the manner of Edgar, or at least adhere to a faith which
models retributive justice. Although, as noted above, such a faith may
render its adherents vulnerable in unjust regimes, precisely because it
tends to mask the role which conventions play in maintaining a just
order, it is at least likely to encourage statesmen who are disposed to
be assertive to confront self-love in a dignified and authoritative
manner.</p>
<h1>Lear's 'Enlightenment'</h1>
<p>We can learn much about the character of Lear's former regime from his
apparently rambling monologues in act 4 (4.6.86-92). These provide
further evidence that Lear's proud assertiveness was always regulated by
a compassionate care for his kingdom: he interrupts his military
reminiscences to call for &quot;peace, peace,&quot; and to demand that the
humblest mouse be given their &quot;piece of toasted cheese&quot; (4.6.89-90). He
was previously supported in his determination to nurture and defend his
just regime--illustrated here by his supervision of a system of legal
tender, which not only facilitated trade, but allowed him to &quot;press...&quot;
recruits to his army--by his proud belief that his laws were ultimately
derived from &quot;nature,&quot; by which he means divine right, rather than
merely devised by human &quot;art&quot; (4.6.82-87). Lear always knew that he
could only defend his compassionate regime by confronting insurrection
and invasion boldly and efficiently: &quot;There's my gauntlet, I'll prove it
on a giant. Bring up the brown bills&quot; (4.6.90-91). He recalls gleefully
celebrating the accuracy of his carefully selected bowmen, perhaps even
on the battle-field itself, where all compassion was temporarily
suspended: &quot;O, well flown, bird! i' th' clout, i'th clout -hewgh!&quot;
(44.6.87-88, 4.6.91-92). We may conclude from this monologue that, as
king, Lear alternated between attempting to cater compassionately even
for the humblest inhabitants of his kingdom, and proudly relishing the
noble assertiveness that allowed him to protect the enclave of justice
which he had painstakingly constructed, sustained by his sense that he
was an emissary of the gods.</p>
<p>Lear's 'enlightenment' disrupts this salutary fusion of natural
compassion and conventional piety and nobility. Schooled by the fool as
well as by events, he has learnt that &quot;when the rain came to wet me
once, and the wind to make me chatter,&quot; they were simply arbitrary
natural forces, since &quot;the thunder would not peace at my bidding&quot;
(4.6.100-03). He now declares that that he has abandoned his belief that
kings are appointed and sustained by divine providence: to &quot;flatter...&quot;
him as if he were a god &quot;was no good divinity&quot; (4.6.96-100). I would
argue that Shakespeare's ultimate purpose in this play is to explore the
complex causes and potentially chaotic consequences of enlightenment. As
we have seen, Shakespeare uses both the fool and Edmund to show that
sceptical forms of philosophy, which place undue emphasis on the power
of self-love, can be a major threat to political authority.</p>
<p>Between them, poor Tom and the fool have indeed convinced Lear that
human nature is primarily self-loving: &quot;but to the girdle do the gods
inherit, beneath is all the fiends': there's hell, there's darkness...&quot;
(4.6.126-27). Lear recoils in shock and disgust from his vision of human
beings as &quot;Centaurs,&quot; who on the surface present a &quot;simp'ring&quot;
conformity to prevailing codes, while beneath &quot;is the sulphurous pit,
burning, scalding, stench, consumption&quot; (4.6.118-31). His horror could
be seen as the original, naive reaction to the reduction of humanity to
its basest drives; a reduction which, one might argue, is almost taken
for granted in much mainstream modern and post-modern thought, as
Shakespeare perhaps anticipates in his portrayal of the Machiavellian
Edmund.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>At the end of the play the Christian doctrines of the Fall and original
sin apparently merge in Lear's mind with the fool's proto-Hobbesian
analysis of the pervasive influence of self-love and the basest physical
passions, as was perhaps previously insinuated by Lear's insistence on
addressing poor Tom as a philosopher. Lear's account of &quot;hell&quot; hangs
between literal and metaphorical senses: his vision of the inferno is
too graphic to dismiss as purely symbolic, but at the same time could be
interpreted in purely material terms -especially as &quot;hell&quot; was a
colloquial term for female genitals (4.6.127). This ambiguity suggests
that the free thinking of the times is no more genuinely philosophical
than the scholastic amalgam of Christianity and classical thought which
it sought to replace, since it too is partly derived from Christian
doctrine.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup></p>
<p>Having been exposed to this amalgam of influences, Lear now believes
that self-love is an ineluctable force: he bids &quot;copulation thrive,&quot; on
the grounds that human beings are no more amenable to restraint than
wrens and flies (4.6.109-31). Lear's recognition that Regan's &quot;heart&quot;
was itself made of &quot;warp'd&quot; material, which led him to abort his
imaginary trial, suspecting &quot;corruption in the place&quot; and &quot;false
justicer[s],&quot; can now be seen as pivotal, since it was a sign of his
capitulation to the pessimism of Tom and the fool (3.6.53-56). If they
are right to identify self-love as the overriding element in human
nature, then it must pervade the very institutions which purport to
protect society from its influence, in exactly the way that the fool's
mock prophecy assumes (3.2.81-94).</p>
<p>From now on, Lear abandons his faith in the moral authority of the
ruling elite, and assumes that there is in fact no substantial
distinction between judges and thieves: &quot;a dog's obey'd in office&quot;
(4.6.150-59).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">[42]</a></sup> His compassionate sense of justice now turns in on
itself: if laws merely enable self-lovers who are dressed in &quot;robes and
furr'd gowns&quot; to subjugate those in &quot;tatter'd] clothes,&quot; then it makes
sense to declare, &quot;None does offend, none, I say none&quot; (4.6.164-68).
This is the key speech in the whole play in many ways, since it
highlights the danger of dismantling the conventional codes of nobility
and piety which reinforce and naturalise virtue, since non-philosophers
would be unlikely to replace these codes with a sober and proportionate
appraisal of self-love.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">[43]</a></sup> It is significant that in rejecting clothes
as representing a corrupt hierarchy, Lear also seeks to deprive himself
of boots, the most unambiguously useful item of clothing (4.6.164-73).</p>
<p>So indiscriminate is Lear's cynicism that he now even refuses to trust
the gentleman who has been sent to retrieve him, despite the fact that
the latter seems to be motivated simply by love for the &quot;most dear&quot;
Cordelia and by pious and dutiful respect, both for her Christ-like
virtue, which &quot;redeems nature from the general curse which twain have
brought her to,&quot; and for the king's own royal authority (4.6.188-207).
Similarly, Lear now makes no distinction between his three sons-in-law,
even though two of them have striven to rescue and reinstate him, and
initially groups even Kent with the &quot;murderers, traitors all&quot; who have
contributed to Cordelia's death (4.6.186-87, 5.3.269-70). (Subsequently,
he fails to show the effusive gratitude which Kent had expected to
receive for his loyal service, perhaps because he is now focused on
pursuing his own personal redemption through his relationship with
Cordelia, rather than on judging the actions of others: 5.3.279-95,
1.4.4-7; see below).</p>
<p>Shakespeare quietly undermines the rationale which Lear gives for his
pessimism: the &quot;beadle...lash[ing] that whore&quot; may indeed &quot;hotly
lust...to use her in that kind for which thou whip'st her,&quot; but this
does not mean that he will act on these desires (4.6.160-63). Similarly,
there is actually a substantial difference between &quot;the usurer&quot; and &quot;the
cozener&quot; whom he &quot;hangs,&quot; since the latter obeys the law, and, despite
his ambiguous status and focus on self-aggrandisement, provides a useful
social service (4.6.163). Thus, whereas Tom invited Lear to concentrate
on motive rather than behaviour in a manner that is typical of
Christian, and especially Protestant theology, Shakespeare covertly
reminds us that it is in fact conformity to the law which sustains
social order -as has been noted, even Goneril and Regan caused no
disruption while they were forced to obey their father's sovereign
power. (One might even add that corrupt authority figures may still play
a role in enforcing public order, as Angelo is initially tried to do in
<em>Measure for Measure</em>.)</p>
<p>Encouraged by the teachings of Tom and the fool, Lear fails to draw a
distinction between the raw self-love of the &quot;cozener&quot; and the &quot;whore&quot;
on the one hand and, on the other, what might well be the sublimated
self-love of the &quot;beadle&quot; and the &quot;usurer,&quot; and ultimately of judges and
kings, whose pride, avarice and lust may be regulated by piety and
honour as well as by expedient conformity, and even at times restrained
by a naturally compassionate disposition. The play itself undoubtedly
presents just regimes as eminently achievable: leaving aside the
passionate sympathy shown both by Edgar and by Cornwall's loyal servant,
and the mixture of natural affection and instilled dutifulness which
drives Gloucester, Albany and Kent to help Lear, and presumably impelled
them to support his previous regime, one may infer from the pious shame
expressed by Cornwall's two compliant servants that the majority even of
those who are partly or mainly regulated by prudent expedience would
normally respect the established values of a just regime (3.7.99-107).
Overall, Shakespeare therefore portrays what Lear thinks of as
enlightenment as in reality merely the substitution of a corrosively
reductive delusion for another set of illusions which were at least
politically useful.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>When Lear has been reunited with Cordelia in what he imagines at first
to be the afterlife, his vision of her as &quot;a soul in bliss&quot; and himself
as &quot;bound upon a wheel of fire,&quot; &quot;scald[ed]&quot; by his own tears, shows
how, under the auspices of poor Tom, he has begun to concentrate
exclusively on his failure to align himself humbly with his own loving
heart; a failure which he sees as having alienated him both from God and
from Cordelia herself, who in his mind now comes to embody the spirit of
Christ's redemptive love (4.7.44-47). Certainly, his newly acquired
Christian principles are in many ways conducive to intimate personal
relationships, since they encourage the humble self-restraint which such
relationships demand, but the corollary of this is that worldly power
and authority are now perceived merely as obstacles to this &quot;bliss,&quot;
since they encourage a potentially divisive pride (see especially
4.6.96-105). By now, Lear's dignified and assertive sense of his own
authority has been dismantled and replaced with an abjectly child-like
humility: he attempts to kneel to Cordelia, dubbing himself &quot;a foolish
fond old man&quot; and offers to drink poison as penance (4.7.58-59,
4.7.71).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">[45]</a></sup> In so doing, he forgets both the generous and prudent
concern for the welfare of the kingdom as a whole which informed his
original plan, and the role that Cordelia herself played in its failure.</p>
<p>Unlike his original wish to retreat to Cordelia's &quot;nursery,&quot; Lear's
desire to &quot;pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh&quot; with his
daughter for the rest of his days is not supported by a cunning and
audacious plan to safeguard both her position and that of the kingdom as
a whole (1.1.123-24, 5.3.11-12).<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">[46]</a></sup> By the end of the play, Lear has
seemingly renounced both his political prudence and his code of spirited
nobility. Consequently, rather than castigating Goneril and Regan for
their callousness, as Cordelia clearly expects at first, he welcomes
prison eagerly (5.3.7-8). Whereas, as king, he saw it as his business to
manipulate or deter ambitious self-lovers, as is implied both by his
original plan to secure his succession and his imagined arraignment of
his daughters, not to mention by his rambling recollections of his
disciplined archers and &quot;brown bills,&quot; he now merely proposes that
Cordelia and he should loftily &quot;laugh at [the] gilded butterflies,
and...poor rogues&quot; who infest the court (4.6.87-92, 5.3.12-13).
Similarly, he has apparently abandoned his former, public-spirited
demand that the gods should punish not only his elder daughters, but all
&quot;covert and convenient seeming&quot; miscreants, in order to focus on a
purely personal redemption, in which an exchange of &quot;blessing&quot; and
&quot;forgiveness&quot; with Cordelia would merge easily with pious &quot;pray[er]&quot;
(3.2.49-59, 5.3.10-12; see also 1.4.275-89, 2.4.227-28, 3.2.1-9). His
new code of piety encourages self-denying love rather than proud,
spirited retribution: &quot;Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, the gods
themselves throw incense&quot; (5.3.20-21).</p>
<p>However, Shakespeare undermines Lear's attempt to abstract his
attachment to Cordelia from the fickle and heartless world of politics
in bitterly ironic fashion: even as the king is proposing that he and
his daughter should spend their days in prison reviewing the &quot;court
news&quot; of &quot;who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out,&quot; &quot;wear[ing]
out&quot; in a spirit of lofty detachment &quot;packs and sects of great ones,
that ebb and flow by th' moon,&quot; Edmund is arranging to have Cordelia
murdered (5.3.17-39). Tom's Christianity and the fool's philosophy seem
to have combined to convince Lear that a wise man cannot resist the
ubiquitous influence of self-love, but must simply strive to restrain
his own pride, while focusing humbly on his intimate attachments.
Ironically, however, although self-restraint and humility no doubt
facilitate the constant trust and care which sustains personal
relationships, in the political world they tend to sap the ability of
rulers to defend the very order that ultimately safeguards these
relationships. Self-lovers are not just, and their predations can only
be countered by emulating their self-assertion, and at times, their
wiliness.</p>
<p>Shakespeare's overall suggestion is therefore that, in order to create a
stable enclave in which self-love is prevented from disrupting constant
attachments, just rulers generally need to supplement their natural
patriotism and compassion with conventional codes of honour and piety
which encourage them to oversee a system of legal and, as a final
resort, military deterrents in a robustly self-assertive and at times
cunningly manipulative manner. The murder of Cordelia reminds both Lear
and the audience of the need for the proud, noble spiritedness which the
kings has seemingly renounced: he implicitly criticises his own
new-found meekness when he declares that he &quot;might have sav'd her&quot; and
that he &quot;kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee,&quot; even emerging from
his grief and recently assumed humility sufficiently to boast of the
days when, with his &quot;good, biting falchion [he] would have made them
skip&quot; (5.3.271, 5.3.275-78). The ongoing tension between Lear's
Christian and quasi-philosophical meekness and his natural and
honourable desire for retribution is highlighted when, after
&quot;preach[ing]&quot; to Gloucester with deceptive humility that the only
appropriate response to &quot;this great stage of fools&quot; is to try to
restrain oneself &quot;patient[ly]&quot; from &quot;wawl[ing] and cry[ing]&quot; like
a baby, he is then suddenly overtaken by a fierce urge to &quot;kill, kill,
kill, kill, kill, kill&quot; his oppressors (4.6.178-87).</p>
<p>In this way, a number of factors combine to depoliticise Lear. In
general, both the fool and poor Tom overrate the power of self-love,
since they see it as barely controllable even on a purely personal
level. The only material remedy which they offer, which is that each
individual should strive to restrain their own pride, not only
side-lines the political sphere, but tends to conflict with the
confident self-assertion which political authority demands: Lear's
Christianised enlightenment leads him to focus on alienated spiritual
states rather than vicious behaviour, and on tenderness rather than
retribution.</p>
<p>To repeat, Shakespeare presents Lear's 'enlightenment' as simply
exchanging a less politically useful set of conventional beliefs--which
are themselves partly derived from pious belief, however much they
present themselves as entirely based on nature--for his code of nobility
and his traditional faith in a just God. If, as I have argued,
Shakespeare uses clothing to represent such codes, it may be significant
that the 'enlightened' Lear substitutes a crown of weeds and flowers for
the one which symbolised his conventional authority (4.6.180-83). After
doffing this alternative 'crown' with a sardonic comment on the limited
protection which it offers-- &quot;a good block&quot;--Lear remarks that &quot;it were
a delicate stratagem, to shoe a troop of horse with felt,&quot; adding that
he nevertheless wishes to &quot;put't in proof,&quot; so that he can &quot;kill, kill,
kill, kill, kill, kill,&quot; presumably after having &quot;stol'n&quot; upon his
enemies with his softly shod cavalry (4.6.185-87). Like the flowery
crown, the felt shoes might appear and feel more natural than
horse-shoes, and are indeed originally organic, unlike the metallic
objects that they replace, yet both are in fact still artifices, and
ones, moreover, which compromise Lear's ability to enforce his will.
Thus, the prescient playwright conceals a warning in his play against a
set of ideas which were arguably to become the dominant intellectual
force as the Enlightenment took root, which purport to base society on
nature for the first time, but are in fact derived from an impoverished
analysis of the human soul.</p>
<p>The teachings of poor Tom and the fool highlight the disjunction between
statesmen and private citizens, since in both cases they encourage the
humility and moderation which trusting attachments inevitably demand,
even as they sap the sublimated pride which may be so useful in public
life. Unlike the fool's teachings, however, Edgar's manipulations are
far from being apolitical. His actions imply that truly passionate and
thoughtful rulers should accept the disjunction between their own
natures and that of their subjects, and seek to reinforce conventional
beliefs which promote contentment and social cohesion, even though they
themselves are completely unmoved by the sublimated pride to which these
beliefs appeal. Having little acquaintance with the fool, Edgar surely
never anticipated that his teachings could ultimately bolster a
nihilistic scepticism which might prove detrimental to such cohesion. By
contrast, the foresightful playwright conceals a warning against a set
of ideas which were arguably to become the dominant intellectual force
in the West as the Enlightenment took root. At the heart of these ideas
is the assumption--shared by the fool and Edmund, and encouraged by poor
Tom--that human nature is dominated by the basest or most bestial
impulses, an assumption which is potentially detrimental to the moral
authority of legal and political institutions. Shakespeare implicitly
advises that the humble, sympathetic egalitarianism which
post-Enlightenment societies might put forward as a substitute for such
authority cannot protect regimes against the inevitable incursions of
self-love.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Shakespeare's aim in this play is to explore the essential nature of
politics. In the state of nature, as outlined in the scenes on the
heath, the patriarchs who become the first monarchs are naturally
motivated to rule by a sympathetic urge to protect their circle of
attachments from the ongoing threat posed by self-love. However,
although the underlying natural function of the regimes which emerge in
this way is therefore to provide a safe enclave within which intimate
attachments may flourish, they inevitably come to rely on the support of
conventional codes of honour and moral duty, and, most importantly, a
faith in a just cosmos, sustained by divine providence. These codes may
be &quot;nothing&quot; when considered from a strictly philosophical
perspective--the fact that this word occurs thirty-six times in the
play, while &quot;nature&quot; and its variants are used forty-seven times, is a
sign that Shakespeare's theme requires him to distinguish carefully
between conventional illusions and natural desires--but they generally
encourage the elite to display the noble assertiveness which enables
them to defend their regimes and implement the laws that control
self-love, while ensuring that the populace defers dutifully to these
laws. In traditional regimes, as is shown by the confused rebukes which
Lear hurls at Regan, the self-denying, loyal service that is instilled
by codes of piety, duty and honour may merge indistinguishably with the
demands which are naturally imposed by intimate attachments.</p>
<p>Such codes gain their power from the way in which they sublimate
self-love into a form which serves these spontaneous demands, thus
appealing simultaneously to two powerful, constituents of human nature,
which would otherwise conflict. Conventional conceptions of nobility and
virtue ensure that the desire to distinguish oneself in the eyes of
others expresses itself in a manner that is broadly just, rather than in
the form of tyrannical ambition, while traditional religious belief
harnesses self-regard to support the political order, both by ascribing
to just and unjust actions a cosmic significance and by promising that
secular justice is supplemented by divine sanctions. Indeed, piety is
perhaps the most powerful of these conventions, since it allows just
rulers to strengthen their regimes by presenting what are in fact simply
ingenious efforts to construct enclaves of order within an arbitrary
universe as fulfilling a divine plan, as Lear plans to do with his
putative house building programme. Shakespeare uses the love test as his
central example of the noble lies by which prudent policies may be
naturalised in the eyes of the populace. As this exercise would have
shown, if it had been carried through in the way that Lear planned, even
sincere feeling itself may at times be usefully exploited to serve a
political purpose.</p>
<p>Shakespeare explores the composition of the traditional polis in order
to compare and contrast the attitudes of three groups of characters to
the conventional beliefs outlined above -four, if you count the
extremely small group of philosophical rulers. Based on the behaviour of
Lear's hundred knights and Cornwall's three servants, we may infer that
a third of the populace are, like Kent, Gloucester, Albany, Cordelia and
Lear himself, motivated by a robust combination of conventional beliefs
and natural attachments. The despair that both Gloucester and Lear show
when they are forced to question their faith in the gods shows that
piety is vital to their well-being, since it satisfies their proud urge
to invest just actions with a cosmic significance. Judging again by
Lear's knights and Cornwall's servants, most of the remaining two thirds
are less passionate and more self-regarding than this first group, and
so are more prone to conform to tyranny. Nevertheless, the pious horror
and sympathy subsequently displayed by the two servants who were
complicit in the blinding of Gloucester suggests that in a just regime,
the self-regard of this second group would normally be kept in check by
conventional principles, supported by a somewhat impoverished capacity
to form attachments, and presumably, as always, by an expedient
conformity. As a general rule, this group would simply conform to the
regime of the day, whether just or tyrannical.</p>
<p>By contrast with both these groups of characters, a third, much smaller
group of egregious narcissists respects authority only when it is
underwritten by military power. These are happy to subvert or manipulate
both the natural attachments and the artificial conventions which
underpin the civic order in order to pursue their ambitions. They are
hampered, however, partly by their pursuit of social distinction
itself--it is this pursuit that exposes Edmund to Edgar's
manipulations--but most of all by their passionate attachments, which
are bound to exert a powerful, potentially humbling influence, even if
these attachments are primarily sensual. This third group may be further
subdivided into those whose self-love is, for imponderable reasons,
naturally dominant, and those such as Edmund, who have been distorted by
their environment, sometimes as a result of the collateral damage caused
by the salutary conventions themselves, and who therefore may retain a
residual capacity to form sympathetic ties.</p>
<p>The opening conversation of the play, which, as is his wont, Shakespeare
uses to introduce his main theme, hints that the play will explore the
limitations of social convention as well as its uses, since Gloucester's
disastrous ostracism of Edmund is implicitly contrasted with the king's
salutary pretence of valuing Cornwall and Albany equally. Particularly
in the absence of an authoritative hierarchy, the just characters are
vulnerable to tyrannical ambition, not only because they assume that
narcissists must share their own capacity to form sympathetic
attachments, but precisely because their habitual convictions lead them
to see self-love as an unnatural or &quot;monstrous&quot; distortion of a cosmic
order, a view which leads them to minimise its innate power and
pervasive influence. Piety and habitual codes of nobility lead the
spirited Kent, Cordelia and Lear himself to display a noble, direct
self-assertion which is counterproductive in unstable times, however
useful it may be in defending just regimes, while, conversely, the
respect which the moderate Albany and Gloucester demonstrate for the
established hierarchies, both secular and celestial, imposes gentlemanly
restraints, and even at times a passive fatalism, which hamper their
capacity to resist self-love. The chaos which descends after the king's
virtual abdication reveals that the old regime has been much more
reliant on his prudent manipulations and careful construction of
military deterrents than either he or the other just characters have
appreciated.</p>
<p>Whereas the just characters may well be induced to rule for lengthy
periods, since their natural patriotism is supported by codes of piety
and nobility, their compassionate love for their country is not
sufficiently intense to impel them to do so entirely willingly, since it
is adulterated by self-love, albeit in a highly sublimated form: it is
significant that in the course of the play, three of these characters
either decline or surrender the crown. The conventional principles by
which Lear is habituated to rule are not sufficiently authoritative to
override completely his intuition that his deepest needs are fulfilled
through trusting personal intimacies. Moreover, he, and no doubt many
just rulers of his ilk, tend to be frustrated, both for natural and
conventionally moral reasons, by the hypocrisies and accommodations
which political life inevitably demands, particularly because their
efforts might appear to be requited merely by the gratifications of
&quot;pomp&quot; and popular adulation, which they may find superficially
enticing, but ultimately insubstantial. Lear's catastrophic anger with
Cordelia in the opening scene is a measure of this frustration, as is
Albany's intense reluctance to take up arms against Cordelia's forces.
Such frustrations are natural to an extent, as is implied by the fact
that they are experienced even by the passionate Edgar as he attempts to
convince Gloucester and Lear that nature is ultimately just, but, by
contrast with Edgar, the conventionally just characters are hampered not
only by the high value which they place on sincere and trusting
attachments, but by their pious and honourable principles. Lear is
perhaps typical of most just rulers in traditional regimes in that he
himself subscribes to the very conventional beliefs which his position
impels him to manipulate.</p>
<p>By contrast, the portrayal of Edgar shows that politics is a natural
vocation for a few very passionate and thoughtful individuals. Having
recognised the futility of pride in all its forms, they are free to
derive satisfaction from a variety of sympathetic ties, whether
patriotic or personal. Although their lives are also inevitably centred
on personal relationships, as is implied by the intensity of Edgar's
response to Gloucester's injuries, their propensity to form attachments
is sufficiently vigorous to spill over into the political sphere in an
entirely spontaneous manner. Under extreme circumstances their political
aims must override their personal attachments, but generally they will
be able to negotiate a compromise between the two. Thus, in what is
arguably the most Platonic of his plays, Shakespeare implicitly takes
issue with Plato's insistence that the philosopher has no desire to
rule, because he starts from the intuition that fulfilment is primarily
to be gained through passionate attachments, rather than through the
love of wisdom.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>Edgar represents a fourth, very small group of deeply passionate and
thoughtful individuals, who are likely to rule not only with absolute
justice, unadulterated by any proclivity for &quot;pomp,&quot; but with shrewd
prudence. Such characters are more able to exploit conventional beliefs
even than the third group of potential tyrants--as Edgar shows at the
end of the play when he manipulates his brother into accepting his
challenge--since they have emancipated themselves from the raw ambition
which ties these latter to an arbitrary hierarchy, as well as from the
sublimated pride which drives conventional piety and nobility. The pious
doctrines which Edgar promulgates not only shield Gloucester and Lear
from the random harshness of nature, which they and many others of their
ilk find almost impossible to bear, but will doubtless also reinforce
the just order which he is about to institute at the end of the play.
Thus, Shakespeare implicitly argues not only that regimes are originally
seeded by natural sympathies, but that on rare occasions they may be
regulated entirely by these sympathies -although, paradoxically, the
natural ruler is likely to manipulate conventional beliefs in a
particularly shameless way, precisely because he has freed himself from
such beliefs.</p>
<p>Shakespeare also shows that factors within a just regime may themselves
be responsible for liberating self-love, and indeed may perhaps
ultimately represent more of a threat than narcissistic ambition, which
is ultimately self-defeating for the reasons given above. Firstly,
sceptical philosophy may undermine salutary conventions. Unlike
Shakespeare's own play, which carefully disguises its deeper argument,
the fool's views directly challenge the assumption that self-love is a
distortion of nature and an offence against the divine order, presenting
it simply as a pervasive, arbitrary force, like &quot;the wind and the rain.&quot;
While Shakespeare himself covertly endorses this analysis, he shows that
the fool is wrong both to express it directly and to conclude from it
that society cannot protect itself.</p>
<p>The fool's eventual desertion of Lear implies that those of a
philosophical bent often tend to prioritise prudent expedience over
sympathetic attachments, which means that their analysis of human nature
may not encompass the intrinsic benefits of just and compassionate rule.
Moreover, the fool's preference for the humble domestic virtues of
self-knowledge and self-restraint over the proud and assertive dignity
of just monarchs shows that he, in common perhaps with many philosophers
of his sceptical ilk, fails to understand that the stability of the
domestic enclaves which he so values is itself ultimately dependent on
the capacity of the political elite to resist the incursions of
potential tyrants. Thus, like Plato before him, although for slightly
different reasons, Shakespeare criticises philosophers who attempt to
eschew politics.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the fool's overly pessimistic claim that self-love is
uncontrollable, his analysis undermines one of the key assumptions upon
which any just legal system must be founded: retributive justice must
attribute moral agency to offenders and an innate capacity for guilt,
but, unmoved as they are by the imperatives of love, which form the
natural foundation of normative social codes, egregious self-lovers
could not actually be said to make free moral choices. Nevertheless,
society simply has to assume that they deserve punishment, since it is
the passionate desire for retribution which generally drives the legal
system, and allows it to fulfil what is in reality its most vital
political function, namely, the establishment of clear deterrents.</p>
<p>Secondly, it would seem that in some contexts certain types of
conventional belief may actively undermine the laws which sustain the
civic order. The strength of Christianity is that it is a uniquely
powerful means of reinforcing faith in divine justice. Rather than
teaching that this justice is immanent in the world, a doctrine which is
always likely to be challenged by the arbitrary harshness of nature, it
limits divine providence to a single act of redemptive mercy, while
maintaining that adversities of all sorts, including the depredations of
self-love, are originally triggered by the proud self-assertion which
led humanity to alienate itself from heaven. However, although this
account offers useful reassurances to the populace, as it does to Lear,
since it provides a more effective argument for divine justice than
religions which attempt to present the gods as micromanaging an
arbitrary universe, it is bound to hamper the rulers themselves for the
following reasons.</p>
<p>In order to present self-love as ineluctable, and therefore suffering as
generally deserved, Christianity, particularly in its Protestant forms,
effectively psychologises both vice and virtue: thus, the pride which
alienates the soul from God becomes the supreme evil, while a humble
acceptance of one's own innate sinfulness and consequent reliance on
Christ's love becomes the ultimate virtue. Not only does Christianity
therefore tend to divert attention away from vicious action, which is of
course the main focus of the law, but, like the fool's philosophy, not
to mention Edmund's, the assumption that all are guilty of original sin
tends to erode the difference between criminals and judges. The
dignified indignation which traditionally motivates just rulers and
judges could now easily be dismissed as merely an expression of pride,
especially by contrast with Christ's humble sacrifices. Moreover, not
only are the institutions which are designed to combat self-love now
easily assumed to be either ineffectual or corrupt, but secular justice
is weakened by the fact that it is no longer seen as being supplemented
by an immanent providence. The overall thrust of these doctrines is that
one should concentrate on aligning oneself humbly with God's redemptive
love, rather than on protecting or correcting others through political
engagement.</p>
<p>Thus, Christianity might easily combine with a philosophical critique of
political engagement to encourage the ruling elite to prioritise the
self-restraint and generosity which personal attachments demand above
the proud virtues of public life, even though these attachments are
ultimately reliant on precisely these virtues for their protection. In
traditional religions, by contrast, the gods are presented both as
modelling and supplementing spirited retribution in a manner which
generally reinforces just regimes. This type of piety may not provide
such a convincing defence of divine providence as Christianity, and on
occasion it may help to instil either naïve overconfidence or passive
fatalism in those who are so disposed, but, unlike certain Christian
doctrines, it is not fundamentally incompatible with the virtues which
are required for public life.</p>
<p>Shakespeare understands that Christian and sceptical philosophy might
work together to usher in a potentially disruptive enlightenment. It is
no coincidence that Edmund's and the fool's emphasis on the primacy of
self-interest is typical of the political philosophers of the early
enlightenment, such as Machiavelli, who prepared the way for Hobbes and
Locke. The portrayal of Lear at the end of the play contains a warning,
carefully disguised for obvious reasons, that it is dangerous to strip
away the conventional beliefs which reinforce authority and encourage
dutiful service. Shakespeare suggests that these are likely to be
replaced, not with a truly philosophical analysis, but with a
misleadingly reductive, or even nihilistic, account of human nature,
which is essentially a secularised version of the doctrine of original
sin, generated by those, like Edmund and the fool, whose thought simply
reflects their own stunted natures. The actual truth, which is that
human society is the theatre of a permanent struggle between self-love
and attachments, is too intricate to be amenable to general
dissemination.</p>
<p>Shakespeare would perhaps not be surprised to learn that in modern,
post-Christian liberal democracies, which are of course founded on
principles ultimately derived from the Enlightenment, the majority might
agree with Lear's scornful account of political &quot;authority&quot;-- &quot;a dog's
obey'd in office&quot; (4.6.158-59)--assuming that any claim to moral
superiority is bound to be fraudulent and rooted in pride. He sees that,
having lost faith in the conventional codes which encouraged deference
and dignified self-assertion, we might come to prefer the humble,
sympathetic approach of Lear at the end of the play to the spirited and
prudent authority which he embodies at the start. However, the play
implies that such an approach could never form the basis of political
rule. For Shakespeare, those in positions of authority must always be
capable of assuming a stance of dignified moral indignation, even,
presumably, in an era when the traditional codes of honour and piety
which used to encourage such a stance have been dismantled. Moreover,
leaders will always feel the need both to conceal their real attachments
and antipathies and to portray themselves as more assured than they
might actually feel, just as Lear does in the opening scene.</p>

of the sort of free-thinking philosophy which could combine with the
theology of the Reformation to instil the radical humility and the
tendency to psychologise sin which he sees as detrimental to a

may be, who, if all his thoughts and actions were submitted to the
laws, would not deserve hanging ten times in his life&quot; -Montaigne,
<em>Essais</em>, ed. Maurice Rat (Paris: Garnier, 1952), bk. 3, chap. 9.
Montaigne accepts the doctrine of <em>Deus absconditus</em>, arguing that
we can have no conception either of God's anger or His love: Elton:
