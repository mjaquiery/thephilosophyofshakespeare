            <p>It is of course highly contentious in our times to claim, as the essays
on this website do, that Shakespeare propounds a systematic and
convincing philosophy of attachment, based on his intuition that
intimate, lasting relationships are the ultimate good. The very idea
that there is a <em>summum bonum</em> which fulfils our deepest yearnings is
likely to be seen as an 'essentialist' fallacy in an era in which only
sexual desire and self-love, or the will to power, are generally
accepted as innate drives. However, there are dissenting voices even in
modern times: attachment theory draws on ethological evidence to
question the reductive accounts of human nature which have prevailed
since the Enlightenment, claiming that attachment constitutes a powerful
system of behaviour in its own right, completely separate from the
desire for food or sex.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> If this is true, lovers, friends and
families who are open to its demands may know more about human nature
than most philosophers, whether ancient or modern.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The approach taken in these essays also runs counter to the
anti-rationalism of post-Enlightenment thought, which has culminated,
not only in the fashionable view of texts as conduits for a chaotic
multiplicity of codes, but, more significantly, in a pervasive
historicism, which represents all pre-Hegelian thought as mere
rationalisation of hegemonic self-interest. However, either historicism
is itself subject to its own reduction of philosophy to 'ideology,' in
which case of course it cannot claim to be true, or it sets itself up as
the only exception to this rule, in which case its contention that the
truth about history is only available to modern thinkers can of course
be challenged in the same way as any other philosophical theory.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> The
key issue here is again the modern tendency to deny that there are
enduring elements in human nature other than self-interest and physical
passion; an orthodoxy which leaves no more room for the innate curiosity
which was traditionally thought to motivate the philosopher's
disinterested pursuit of truth than it does for devoted attachment.</p>
<p>It is almost equally contentious to suggest, as these essays also do,
that Shakespeare carefully conceals his philosophical arguments from
those who simply wish to be entertained. This theory is, however, much
more plausible than might at first appear. It is well known that oral,
or scribal culture, which persisted throughout the Renaissance, valued
secrecy simply as the best way of preserving knowledge.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> Equally,
there is no doubt that the orthodox critical view in this period was
that serious literature is allegorical and that the purpose of allegory
was to divide its audience, addressing different messages to different
types of reader.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Sir John Harrington is typical in suggesting that
&quot;fables&quot; not only protect truth from &quot;prophane wits&quot; and aid memory, but
also allow their creators to appeal simultaneously to contrasting types
of interest, since superficial readers stick to the literal or the moral
level, while the more philosophical enjoy exploring the underlying
thought.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> Moreover, pre-Enlightenment philosophers in particular, it
has been argued, are often concerned not only to avoid censorship and
persecution,<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> but actively to protect the ordinary citizen, in the
belief that there is a permanent tension between their own natural
curiosity and the conventional moral and religious beliefs which sustain
political society.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Shakespeare's own least reserved, and therefore perhaps most startling,
pronouncement on this issue is to be found in sonnet 94, where he argues
that thoughtful people should &quot;not do the thing they most do show,&quot; and,
even when &quot;moving others,&quot; should themselves be &quot;unmoved, cold, and to
temptation slow,&quot; partly in order to maintain their own autonomy--for
only those who are &quot;lords and owners of their faces&quot; can &quot;inherit
heaven's graces&quot;--and partly to protect the community, for those who
seek to promulgate their thoughts too enthusiastically may come to
resemble &quot;lilies that fester [which] smell far worse than weeds.&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>What gives the plays their extraordinarily subtle suggestiveness is that
Shakespeare is perfectly happy attending primarily to his own
philosophical development, while offering indirect clues to his thought
which are designed to allow his readers to overhear his meditations, as
it were, if they are sufficiently interested. The advice given to
readers in the preface to the first folio, which is to &quot;reade him,
therefore; and againe and againe,&quot; according to their &quot;divers
capacities,&quot; &quot;and if then you doe not like him, surely you are in some
manifest danger, not to understand him,&quot;<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> suggests that the plays
demand a painstaking absorption from his more contemplative readers,
which is implicitly distinguished from the fleeting entertainment which
they offer audiences. Shakespeare's educated contemporaries would have
been much more routinely alert to the presence of hidden meanings than
their modern counterparts, just as they would have found the elitism and
self-sufficiency of his approach more congenial than readers who have
been brought up in a liberal and egalitarian age.</p>
<p>The vividness of Shakespeare's characterisation conceals his abstract
thought, only revealing it to those who are willing to contemplate the
ironies of the plot and the intricate network of comparisons and
contrasts between the characters which his mature plays invariably
create. The plays also hint at their underlying meaning through a
variety of more local techniques, the most common of which include
symbolism and recurrent leitmotifs or verbal echoes, contradictions or
inconsistencies and the insertion of apparently inconsequential or
purely flippant conversations -which are often more likely to express
Shakespeare's underlying thought than the more dramatic passages.</p>
